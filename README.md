## Introduction

See if this resonates with you…
You’re smart. You’re very capable. You’re excellent at what you do but for some reason, it’s been hard for you to lead a 
successful, fulfilling life. Perhaps you know of others who are not as smart or as capable as you, but they seem to be 
happier and living a more fulfilling life. 
What gives? Why is that? And what can you do to change that and get on the happy, successful, fulfilled bandwagon that 
many others are on?
The answer is you can do a lot. So much of it is mindset and having the discipline to do the things that you need to do 
to improve your life. But the other reason why you may be struggling is simply that you don’t have the good, nuts and 
bolts information on exactly what to do. If you don’t know what you need to know, then how would you even know it? 
Knowledge is power and half of the problem is solved when you gain the knowledge you need to know to improve your life. 
The other half is that you need to get motivated and inspired to take action to change. 
This eBook will give you the nuts and bolts you are looking for, but also, hopefully, it will inspire you to take the 
necessary action you need to take. You see, this eBook is a summary of over 70 books that the author read and has 
applied successfully to achieve financial independence at 32 and live a purpose-driven life.

What is the secret?

The formula for a fulfilling life is autonomy, mastery, and purpose. What this eBook is meant to do is to not only give 
you the information that you need to know but also build you up in a layered approach so you may reach your full potential.
The first step is to implement healthy self-management techniques to maximize your time so you may have agency – 
to obtain the inner power that you will need to act. We will cover this in PART 1: Autonomy. 

The second step is to use your time effectively to build up a skill of your choice. This skill is something that you 
can continually improve upon. This will be covered in PART 2: Mastery which is a never-ending climb of improvement. 
You can not stop at a plateau and enjoy the view because it breeds complacency.

The third and most important step is utilizing your agency and mastery of skill to help more people than just yourself 
without expecting anything in return – this is about your purpose. This is where you build your strong social network 
where you can have a meaningful and positive impact.
It is important to note that there is no final destination or state of mind to get to here. The journey is the destination.
The joy is in the journey. It is a constant never-ending journey of self-improvement. 
No matter how high you progress in life, there is always going to be more to become – more to desire – more to accomplish - more to distract you.

The author firmly beleives that we do not belong to ourselves, we belong to the universe. Just as a plant grows to reach the sun, you need to grow
to reach your intellectual potential and reshape the environment into something better for the people that come after you.
The evolutionary pressure that molded us, rewards us with happy brain chemicals and punishes us with anxiety and depression
when we get off track. This guide is to help you find the track, stay on it and go as fast as you can.
