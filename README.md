## Introduction

See if this resonates with you…
You’re smart. You’re very capable. You’re excellent at what you do but for some reason, it’s been hard for you to lead a successful, fulfilling life. Perhaps you know of others who are not as smart or as capable as you, but they seem to be happier and living a more fulfilling life. 
What gives? Why is that? And what can you do to change that and get on the happy, successful, fulfilled bandwagon that many others are on?
The answer is you can do a lot. So much of it is mindset and having the discipline to do the things that you need to do to improve your life. But the other reason why you may be struggling is simply that you don’t have the good, nuts and bolts information on exactly what to do. If you don’t know what you need to know, then how would you even know it? Knowledge is power and half of the problem is solved when you gain the knowledge you need to know to improve your life. The other half is that you need to get motivated and inspired to take action to change. 
This eBook will give you the nuts and bolts you are looking for, but also, hopefully, it will inspire you to take the necessary action you need to take. You see, this eBook is a summary of over 70 books that the author read and has applied successfully to achieve financial independence at 32 and live a purpose-driven life.
What is the secret?

The formula for a fulfilling life is autonomy, mastery, and purpose. What this eBook is meant to do is to not only give you the information that you need to know but also build you up in a layered approach so you may reach your full potential.
The first step is to implement healthy self-management techniques to maximize your time so you may have agency – to obtain the inner power that you will need to act. We will cover this in PART 1: Autonomy. 

The second step is to use your time effectively to build up a skill of your choice. This skill is something that you can continually improve upon. This will be covered in PART 2: Mastery which is a never-ending climb of improvement. There are no plateaus. 

The third and most important step is utilizing your agency and mastery of skill to help more people than just yourself – this is about your purpose. This is where you build your strong social network where you can have a meaningful and positive impact.
It is important to note that there is no final destination or state of mind to get to here. The journey is the destination. The joy is in the journey. It is a constant never-ending journey of self-improvement. 
No matter how high you progress in life, there is always going to be more to become – more to desire – more to accomplish. 
The basis of life is freedom. The purpose of life is the joy of creating your own reality. The result of life is expansion – expansion of you – of who you are and who you become. All the goals in the world are just the excuse to take the journey through life. There is nothing wrong at all with desire, and you get to desire to be, do and have whatever you want. Some religions and cultures teach that it is wrong to desire and that you need to go meditate in a mountain for 5 years in silence to attain happiness and fulfillment. But even the desire to NOT desire is a desire! 

You cannot stop it…

You cannot squelch it…

The author firmly believes that these are the rules determined from our evolutionary path on this planet that
allowed us to survive and thrive to where we are today. So might as well do your best and desire all you want while you enjoy the journey to a fulfilling life!
Let us begin this journey with the most simple and important steps, how to change your mindset so that you can have a strong foundation to create the life you really want.
