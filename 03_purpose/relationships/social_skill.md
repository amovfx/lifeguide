# Social Skills

Remember, relationships are one of the top key aspects of your life. We don’t just need others to survive – 
we desire to have deep, long-lasting, meaningful relationships with our family, friends, and even in our 
professional world. Having good social skills will help you create the best relationships you can. 

What can you do? 

Smile more. It may seem like such a no-brainer, but just giving someone a friendly smile lifts your mood and 
theirs too. When you smile, you tell yourself and others that all is well in your world, that you are a 
happy person, trustworthy and approachable. When you smile, the whole world will smile with you, and when you 
frown the world will reflect that back to you too. 

Another thing that you can do to hone your social skills is to pay attention to how you listen. The basics are, 
listen and don’t interrupt someone when they are trying to speak to you. Seek to understand, 
then to be understood. Listening is the most valuable skill you will ever develop. Get amazing at this. 
Develop your aural listening, then work on developing your empathic listening.  

Empathic listening is the ability to put yourself into the shoes of another person and to empathize 
with how they feel. In addition, empathic listening highlights the fact that the words that come out of a 
person’s mouth may not match the feeling that they give off in delivery. For example, a mother who is mad at 
her child may yell, “Don’t you know that I love you?” The child knows instantly that the words coming out of 
the mother’s mouth don’t match the feeling. That’s the difference between verbal and non-verbal communication. 
When the feeling matches the words, it’s a successful delivery of the message or transaction. When they don’t 
match, it’s not. Be aware of conflicting messages from people. 

In this example with the mother, it’s a very apparent “failure to communicate.” But there are many more subtle 
things to look out for. If someone like your boss, employee, or co-worker is stressed out, you can tell in their 
delivery of the message. There is a saying that goes, “You cannot NOT communicate.” It’s so true. Listen for the 
tone in their voice and you will get 95% of the message instead of from the words they choose. 
Also, to improve your social skills, take a genuine interest in other people’s interests and understand why they 
like what they do, even if it’s something that you’re not into yet. Have a sort of child-like curiosity about o
thers and it will serve you very well. 

Another thing that you can do is to never criticize anyone publicly. Others will fear that you may do the same 
thing to them in the future and want to avoid you. And don’t criticize anyone through email either. We tend to 
unleash our wrath more readily and easily through emails and texts because there is no immediate response that 
we have to deal with in person. Be very careful with emails and texts. It’s the quickest and easiest way to ruin 
a relationship. 

Instead, be lavish and generous with your praise. Look for the good in others and the good is what you’ll see. 
And admit your own mistakes openly. Don’t make excuses. Don’t blame. Take responsibility. Call attention to 
other people’s mistakes indirectly. Be kind, brave, honest, and devoted to your beliefs. Surround yourself with 
good people. Life’s joys are in becoming a more loving, humble person – not in gaining material possessions or 
social status. Read the book “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie. 

Dealing with Assholes

When you master something and become a leading expert, you will lose all the benefits of all your effort if 
you can't retain humility. You need to work with people to accomplish tasks that are bigger than what you can 
do by yourself. And those people are not going to want to work with someone self-centered, braggadocios, 
and selfish. 

Although it’s a bit of a contentious term, asshole is the right term for all those people who bully or put 
down others.

There are several reasons why it is important to steer clear of assholes… 

Assholes are bad for business. No one wants to take orders from an asshole or work for them. Their 
bullshit has an area of effect. It is worse when you get an asshole in management.
The negativity that they create around them can permeate an entire company, grow like cancer, and eventually 
destroy the company culture and even the company itself.
An asshole-free environment creates a great working environment. Fewer assholes means more equality for the team.

Multiple studies show that giving people higher social status enables asshole behavior. This is why there is a 
tendency for anyone who advances to management levels to become more of an asshole. 
There is an inverse correlation between being an asshole and being a good manager. In other words, the better a 
manager is, the less of an asshole that manager is…
Managers set the tone and the company’s cultural attitude by how they treat others and how they act while under 
stress. This is why any manager needs to foster an attitude of cooperation amongst employees instead of competition. 

The human moral compass is highly malleable to the moral compass of the group. A good leader is going to 
bring out the best in a group. A bad one brings out the worst.
Do all you can to avoid assholes in your life or else you run the risk of their negativity and attitudes 
rubbing off on you. In other words, avoid assholes or become one.

But what if you don’t have a choice? 

Build emotional distance between any asshole you encounter and yourself. In other words, deal with them on 
only a purely necessary level and don’t invite them into your life in any way, shape, or form. Assholes need 
to go because negative actions have 5 times the effect over positive ones.
Champion a no-asshole policy wherever you go. If you are in a leadership position and have a high performing asshole.
Write them a stellar letter recommendation and ship them to the competition. You will see a productivity increase.
