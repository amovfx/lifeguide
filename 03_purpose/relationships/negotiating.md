##Negotiation

Does the thought of having to negotiate a deal with someone make you feel tense? Is it something that you dread, or something that you have mastered and look forward to? 
For most of us, we dread it. Why? Because most of us don’t know how to negotiate anything well – and yet, it’s a fundamental part of life. 
Every interaction you have with a human being is a negotiation. Why are most of us are never trained in how to do it?
In his book, “Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as If Your Life Depended on It,” Chris Voss explains how to get what you want when you negotiate anything with anybody. Chris worked for the FBI as a hostage negotiator. He is an expert in negotiating situations that have lives on the line.
At the heart of negotiation is emotional intelligence and effective listening. When you are a better listener or more empathetic, you can become a better negotiator. And when you are a better negotiator, it’s easier to reach your goals because you know how to get others to help you. Effective negotiating is being an effective listener while getting someone to give you what you want. 

Here are 7 key points from the book:
### 1) Use active listening 
Most of us don’t know how to listen. We listen for what we want to hear and filter out the rest. Not only that, but we tend to think more about what we are going to say next rather than really listen. Active listening is having no filter, with the intent of really understanding what the other side is saying, and more importantly, feeling. 
### 2) Be a mirror
Being a mirror to what the other person is saying is about repeating the last three words or the last three most important words from the other person. Also, mimicking their body language, tone of voice and inflection helps you to connect and relate to them better. Feeling what someone else is feeling is called neural resonance. 
### 3) Don’t feel their pain; label it
Label what the other person feels when you think you know how they are feeling. But don’t tell them. Ask. And if you don’t want to ask, then use tentative statements that begin with: 
“It seems like….”
“It sounds like…”
“So is it true that…”
Then, if the other person accuses you of telling them how they feel, with these “tentative" statements, you can say, “Well, I didn’t say that you felt that way. What I said was that it seemed like you felt that way.” 
### 4) Beware of “Yes”—Master “No”
A “no” is better than an insincere “yes.” Aim to get the other person to say “no” so that you can operate from there. Getting the other person to say “no” gives them the power and a feeling of safety. Once they have said “no,” they are more likely to open up with the truth. 
### 5) Be the first to anchor
Anchoring means calling out the number first to which all other numbers will be compared. When you anchor the number first, you have the advantage. 
### 6) Priming and Consistency Bias
When the other person makes an offer, use words like “generous” and “fair.” They will then subconsciously want to live up to those attributes.
### 7) Be willing to walk away
To negotiate effectively, you must be willing to walk away from the deal. Don’t be needy. Shake things up if the other person offers something that doesn’t work for you. Use “I” to bring the focus back to you.
