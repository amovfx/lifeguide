# The Future.

The next generation economy will be founded upon different specialized internets. These will work together and
intertwine to give humanity far lower costs in production, increase global access and drive prosperity for all.

You could also see these as additional layers in our communications internet. This has been made possible by an exponential drop
in the price of computation.

###Monetary Internet

The monetary internet was made possible by bitcoin. At it's heart, bitcoin is an algorithmic solution to settlement long thought
to be impossible. What it enabled is the update and verification of a decentralized database. Traditionally,
settlement was done by highly regulated banks. It is expensive and slow. Now, prosumers have an additional tool in their belt to lower costs further! 
They no longer have to open a bank to conduct business. The monetary network spans the globe and has near zero operating costs. 
The monetary network is going to be a few layers. It will be made up of specialized blockchains connected together though lightning networks. This is similar to how our
communications network evolved. Ethernet is a broadcast network, and TCP/IP is the routing layer. Blockchains are
broadcast networks and lightning networks are routing networks like TCP/IP.  We will be transfering value around the world
without banks.

###Energy Internet

As green energy rises, a growing portion of the energy market will fall to prosumers instead of monolithic
electric companies. Again look at the added advantage the prosumer gets with solar panels on their house. Costs
of their production drops even further! 

This really starts to get crazy when you combine this with the monetary network. Lightning networks have the ability
to package communications along with a payment. So your light-bulb can publish a smart contract to purchase electricity
from your neighbors solar panels or vice versa. The future is a place where light bulbs will be bidding for their
electricity use and solar panels are billing consumer devices directly.

###Logistics Internet

Even today, we are seeing the advent of self driving cars. It doesn't take much of a mental leap to picture a world where drivers are
replaced with machines. The delivery of pysical goods will drop further for producers as they can deliver their goods by 

Storage is a huge problem. Warehouses are owned by individual suppliers and not even full. Trucks are 60% full.
THe internet will optimize this 
###Material Internet
Breakthroughs in 3d printing will revolutionize manufactureing. Communities will have their own 3d printer. The goods
that you print will be able to be recycled back into 3d printers.

###Internet of Things
Due to the monetarty internet, we can enable machines to pay each other. You can see how costs will drop even further.
When you pay self driving car to deliver some materials you 3d printed it will use those funds to purchase electricity
driectly from a windmill or solar panel. It will be also be able to purchase software upgrades that make it more
efficient. In this future machines will be able to own themselves. If it's light goes out, it can pay a 3d printer directly
for a replacement. If it is not being used, it could sell it's electricity back to the grid and even itself to be recylced
into something else.
