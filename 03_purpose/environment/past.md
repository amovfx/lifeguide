# Our history

Evolutionary psychology and the power of abstraction allows us to cooperate.
How record keeping enables us to cooperate.
Industrial revolutions. What are they,

This section will summarize our history from when we wandered as nomadic tribes, and through the various industrial revolutions.

I would like to focus on a few things, when we were nomadic because we spent most of our evolutionary time
in this organizational structure and industrial revolutions which restructured our civilization.

The difficult thing about understanding humanity during our nomadic years is that no one knew how
to write, we have some cave paintings but no records.

Source what we know about pre agraian humans and evolutionary psychology. Because of our ability to 
build stories, we were able to complete a goal while not being able to communicate over
large distances.

An industrial revolution happens when a revolution in communications, logistics and energy happen.
So if we look at our first one that brought us out from the plains into an agraian society, that would
be cuniform, our first form of writing, the wheel which enabled transport and pottery, and fire.
Once those technologies converged, we had an industrial revolution. 

The important one to pay attention to is how humanity keeps records and break throughs in that.

Explain how writing enabled our ability to build abstractions upon our collective immagination.
