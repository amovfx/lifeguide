# Our history

When you think about how fast human civilization has been evolving, it’s rather mind-boggling. Not too long ago, there was no internet. No one had a “smart” phone which has enough computing power to rival the best computers on the planet just 15 to 20 years ago. 
We couldn’t connect with other people in other lands without traveling there. And Google was just a funny-sounding word…
It wasn’t long ago that we were trading beads for feathers with one another. Most of our evolutionary time that man has been in existence was spent in the nomadic period.
Evolutionary psychology and the power of abstraction allows us to cooperate with one another, but the problem is that powerful big tech companies are causing much more harm than good by suppressing information. Case in point, whistleblower and ex-Google employee Zach Vorhies went public with information about how Google blacklists websites. As they say, power corrupts, and absolute power over information corrupts absolutely. 
But how did we get here? And what does the future hold for us? 
Let’s quickly look at how we started, the three industrial revolutions, and later we will discuss the fourth one. 

### Nomadic Period: 190,000 BC to 10,000 BC
In our relatively short time as humans, our longest period was the nomadic period. Nomad means not having a permanent address and following herds of animals as they migrate. That should give you some perspective as to how fast we are evolving. In other words, we spent most of our evolutionary time as nomads in this organizational structure. Industrial revolutions restructured our civilization.
The difficult thing about understanding humanity during our nomadic years is that no one knew how to write. We have some cave paintings but no records. Because of our ability to build stories, we were able to complete a goal while not being able to communicate over large distances.
An industrial revolution happens when a revolution in communications, logistics, and energy happens. So, if we look at the first one that brought us out from the plains into an agrarian society, that would be cuneiform, our first form of writing, the wheel which enabled transport, pottery, and fire. Writing enabled our ability to build abstractions upon our collective imagination. Once those technologies converged, we had an industrial revolution. 

### The First Industrial Revolution: 1765
Mechanization was the biggest change for the first industrial revolution. The mechanization of agriculture and the invention of the steam engine helped spur on the first industrial revolution. The extraction of coal was also a major contributor. This new type of energy later helped in the manufacturing of trains and railroads. 

### The Second Industrial Revolution: 1870
About a century later after the first industrial revolution, the second one came in the form of oil, gas and electricity. The internal combustion engine was invented, along with the telephone, the telegraph, chemical synthesis, and the production of steel. The most important invention was that of the automobile and the airplane. To this day, the second industrial revolution was the most important one. 

### The Third Industrial Revolution: 1969
Nuclear energy starts us off with the third industrial revolution. This third industrial revolution created electronics, telecommunications, and computers. It brought us biotechnology, space expeditions, and research. It also brought us Robots, PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) which are giving us higher and higher levels of automation. 
It also brought us Google, social media, the ability to connect with others around the world instantly, and about 6,000 scientific inventions that have been suppressed by government agencies to protect fossil fuel holdings and other interests.
