# Relationships

When we use the term “relationships,” we are including every type: romantic, friendship, work and career, your neighbors, clients, customers and more. As stated earlier, relationships are arguably the most important aspect of life besides your health. Without them, life would feel meaningless for the most part. We all enjoy connecting with others on some level, whether that be finding the love of our life, or connecting with a new friend with whom we have something in common. 
And therefore, your purpose is intricately connected to your relationships. In almost every case, when a highly successful person has “made it” in life, what they want to do later is to give back to humanity and the community that supported them in their endeavors – it’s called philanthropy. In other words, the ultimate desire/goal is to be of service to others – it’s almost a universal desire once a person has “made it to the top.”
One of the keys to success in life and fulfilling your purpose starts with mastering your relationships. It is the most valuable, productive thing you will ever do. 
As mentioned earlier, one of the best books on relationships is “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie. According to Wikipedia, “Over 30 million copies have been sold worldwide, making it one of the best-selling books of all time.” 
We have discussed a few of the points from the book already, but the following is more extensive. In the description for the original book, it promises twelve things that the book will do for you:
Get you out of a mental rut, give you new thoughts, new visions, new ambitions.
Enable you to make friends quickly and easily.
Increase your popularity.
Help you to win people to your way of thinking.
Increase your influence, your prestige, your ability to get things done.
Enable you to win new clients, new customers.
Increase your earning power.
Make you a better salesman, a better executive.
Help you to handle complaints, avoid arguments, keep your human contacts smooth and pleasant.
Make you a better speaker, a more entertaining conversationalist.
Make the principles of psychology easy for you to apply in your daily contacts.
Help you to arouse enthusiasm among your associates.
In this book, there are three fundamental techniques in handling people. They are:
Don’t complain, condemn, or criticize because you will never get the result that you desire. 
Give sincere and honest appreciation to others. People can tell when you don’t mean what you say. Remember, you cannot NOT communicate. Your appreciation must be heartfelt, sincere, and meaningful. Appreciating others is a powerful tool. Also, people cannot do their best while they are being criticized so it never works anyway. 
See things from the point of view of others and inspire them through their eyes. Forget your own perspective but combine what you want with what they want so that they will be eager to work with you. 
In addition, the book has a section about “Six Ways to Make People Like You.” They are: 
Become genuinely interested in others.
Smile. Smiling makes others feel great, and it works for you too. 
Remember people’s names. A person’s name, to that person, is the most important word in all languages. Try to memorize people’s names and it will help you in every social situation.
Be a good listener. We already discussed this. Many times, people just want a good listener and don’t want to be entertained by your side of the conversation. You must care about what other people have to say to be a good listener. 
Talk to others about what they are interested in. That’s how to make it into their heart. It makes them feel valued. 
Make the others feel important – and do it genuinely. Allow them to talk about themselves. Treat others the way you want to be treated. 
There are many other words of wisdom from the book such as avoid arguing because even if we win, we still lose. Don’t ever flat-out tell someone that they are wrong because it will insult their pride and offend them. If you are wrong, admit it emphatically and quickly. Be friendly from the start, even if you are upset. Start with questions where the person will answer “yes,” and talk about things that you agree on, not the things that you don’t. Let the other person do most of the talking. Try to see things from their perspective. And be sympathetic with their needs, ideas, and desires. 
There are many more words of wisdom which is why it’s a good idea to buy that book. Many famous people such as Warren Buffet swear by it. 
Negotiation
Does the thought of having to negotiate a deal with someone make you feel tense? Is it something that you dread, or something that you have mastered and look forward to? 
For most of us, we dread it. Why? Because most of us don’t know how to negotiate anything well – and yet, it’s a fundamental part of life. 
You have to negotiate with almost everyone such as with a spouse, a child, a boss, an employee, a professor, a business partner, a client, or a customer. And yet, most of us are never trained in how to do it. 
In his book, “Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as If Your Life Depended on It,” Chris Voss explains how to get what you want when you negotiate anything with anybody. Chris worked for the FBI as a hostage negotiator, and in his TED Talk, explained how he successfully negotiated with bank robbers, terrorists, kidnappers, and others of that type – even mothers-in-law!
At the heart of negotiation is emotional intelligence and effective listening. When you are a better listener or more empathetic, you can become a better negotiator. And when you are a better negotiator, it’s easier to reach your goals because you know how to get others to help you. Effective negotiating is about being an effective listener but also enlisting the other person into giving you what you want. 
Here are 7 key points from the book:
### 1) Use active listening 
Most of us don’t know how to listen. We listen for what we want to hear and filter out the rest. Not only that, but we tend to think more about what we are going to say next rather than really listen. Active listening is having no filter, with the intent of really understanding what the other side is saying, and more importantly, feeling. 
### 2) Be a mirror
Being a mirror to what the other person is saying is about repeating the last three words or the last three most important words from the other person. Also, mimicking their body language, tone of voice and inflection helps you to connect and relate to them better. Feeling what someone else is feeling is called neural resonance. 
### 3) Don’t feel their pain; label it
Label what the other person feels when you think you know how they are feeling. But don’t tell them. Ask. And if you don’t want to ask, then use tentative statements that begin with: 
“It seems like….”
“It sounds like…”
“So is it true that…”
Then, if the other person accuses you of telling them how they feel, with these “tentative" statements, you can say, “Well, I didn’t say that you felt that way. What I said was that it seemed like you felt that way.” 
### 4) Beware of “Yes”—Master “No”
A “no” is better than an insincere “yes.” Aim to get the other person to say “no” so that you can operate from there. Getting the other person to say “no” gives them the power and a feeling of safety. Once they have said “no,” they are more likely to open up with the truth. 
### 5) Be the first to anchor
Anchoring means calling out the number first to which all other numbers will be compared. When you anchor the number first, you have the advantage. 
### 6) Priming and Consistency Bias
When the other person makes an offer, use words like “generous” and “fair.” They will then subconsciously want to live up to those attributes.
### 7) Be willing to walk away
To negotiate effectively, you must be willing to walk away from the deal. Don’t be needy. Shake things up if the other person offers something that doesn’t work for you. Use “I” to bring the focus back to you. 

## Trust

The Webster dictionary describes trust as the “assured reliance on the character, ability, strength, or truth of someone or something.” Trust is defined as the confidence you have in someone. Trust is one of the most important qualities that you or any entity such as a business can have. Without trust, a business will collapse over time. And if others don’t trust you, your life will suffer in almost every manner.
The author Stephen M. Covey (the son of Stephen R. Covey) wrote a good book titled, “The Speed of Trust.” In his book, he explains how trust has a direct impact on the economics of any business, and individuals too. 
Therefore, it’s important to cultivate trust in yourself first. In other words, if you say you’re going to do something, even if it is just for you, then do it. This is why you may have to remove some of the commitments that you make to yourself – so that you can keep the most important ones. 
Here are three lessons from the book:
Lesson 1: Trust increases speed and thus lowers costs in businesses.
When customers trust a business to deliver what they want and in a timely fashion, they have trust in that company. For example, people trust FedEx to deliver packages overnight. FedEx is exceptional at keeping their word that they will, quite literally, deliver. The trust that customers have in them for speed increases the speed of customer decision-making. They don’t hesitate to decide which company to choose when their package “absolutely, positively has to be there overnight.” Trust increases speed. It speeds up interactions and lowers costs.
But by the same token, not having trust can have the opposite effect. Think about what happened at every airport after 9/11. It used to only take half an hour to go through security, and now it takes about one and a half hours. Trust speeds up transactions. Lack of trust slows it way down. 
Lesson 2: You first have to trust yourself; trust is similar to confidence.
Trust must start with yourself. If you don’t believe in yourself, then how do you expect others to? So, build trust in yourself. Keep your word to yourself. If you commit to doing something, do it. And if you are over-committed on things, then remove some of the commitments until you can keep all your commitments to yourself. For example, if you commit to working out 3 times a week, then do it. It’s for your own good anyway. 
Lesson 3: For business, try to develop societal trust through contribution.
According to Covey, for a business, trust can be applied to 3 groups: the customers, the employees, and society. The Rodney King LA riots in 1992 highlighted the fact that no one ransacked or destroyed any McDonald’s businesses because McDonald’s was viewed by society at large as a trusted business.  Why were they trusted? McDonalds had a history of giving free cups of coffee for the homeless, had literacy programs, jobs for the less privileged, and gave basketballs for teenagers to shoot hoops in their community. 
Trust is a universal asset that can be created by everyone and anyone. Conducting yourself in a way that promotes trust will flourish in all your relationships, personal and business alike. Plus, it facilitates good communication.
Trust is one of the most powerful forms of motivation and inspiration. People want to be trusted. They respond to trust and thrive on it. This is why cultivating self-trust is critical. Do what you write down.
Covey says that to develop great trust in yourself, you must have the four cores. Here they are:
### 1) Integrity: Integrity is about keeping your word and being honest with both yourself and others. It’s also about admitting when you get lucky and being humble in how you portray yourself. 
### 2) Intent: Intent is about not having ulterior motives but having admirable ones instead. It’s about putting meaningful work above becoming rich. It’s about having positive pro-social motives and behavior.
### 3) Capabilities: Capabilities are about being competent at what you do and being the kind of person who wants to develop and learn new skills even though you don’t have to. Not only will you be more confident, but others will feel more confident in you too. 
#33 4) Results: Results are about building a track-record of deeds that you completed and were committed to.
