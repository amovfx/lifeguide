# Teamwork

Being able to work well with others on a team is a valuable ability to have. It’s one of the top things a 
company looks for in an employee. But it’s also a desire for employees who understand that working with a good, 
strong team reaps many rewards. 
The Deloitte Millennial Survey of 2016 showed that for millennials, working with a strong team where there is 
active encouragement of ideas amongst employees, free-flowing communication, mutual support, respect, and 
tolerance would be enough to make them want to stay on the job. 
Here are the crucial elements to building a productive team:
 * Communication: This is the most important aspect of teamwork. All team members must be updated on the progress 
   of the project. But also, there has to be mutual respect among all team members, and management must be 
   encouraging to every team member too which helps build trust and helps to get the most out of everyone. 
   Respect for one another is crucial regardless of their ability or experience. 
 * Ideas: A team must feel comfortable with one another to brainstorm effectively to solve problems. 
   A trusting and respectful team environment can help foster creative ideas. When there is trust and a 
   genuine effort from all team members to succeed, every team member will feel comfortable contributing. 
   The best brainstorming ideas come from high-functioning teams.
 * Support: When you foster a spirit of cooperation within a team instead of competition, everyone benefits. 
   Members are glad to share information and knowledge that they have with others, and it creates a synergistic 
   effect. In other words, the ability of the team is greater than the sum of its parts. This is the only way to 
   exceed a sum of total individual contributions. Team members are happy to help one another, and a spirit of 
   comradery and connection is created. The result is high productivity from the team and high satisfaction from 
   the members.
   
It's a win-win situation. 
We are stronger together.
