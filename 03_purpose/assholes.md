# Assholes

When you master something and become a leading expert, you will lose all the benefits of all your
effort if you can't retain humility. You need to work with people to accomplish tasks that are bigger than what you can do by yourself.

Asshole, is the right term for all those people who bully or put down others.

Assholes are bad for business, their bullshit has an area of effect. It is worse when you get an asshole in management.

An asshole free environment creates a great working environment. Less assholes means more equality for the team.

Multiple studies show that giving people higher social status enables asshole behaviour.

There is an inverse correlation between being an asshole and being a good manager.

To reduce asshole behaviour foster cooperation rather than competition.

The human moral compass is highly malleable to the moral compass of the group. Avoid assholes or become one.

Build emotional distance with any asshole you encounter.

Assholes need to go because negative actions have 5x times the effect over positive ones.

Champion a no asshole policy wherever you go. We as a species have to clean up their mess.
