# Social Skills

Smile.
Listen. This is being repeated from last slide because of how important it is. Don’t interrupt.
Take a genuine interest in other people’s interests and understand why they like what they do.
Never criticize publicly.
Be lavish and generous with your praise.
Admit your own mistakes openly. Don’t make excuses. Don’t blame. Take responsibility.
Call attention to other people’s mistakes indirectly.
Be kind, brave, honest and devoted to your beliefs.
Surround yourself with good people.
Life’s joys are in becoming a more loving, humble person, not material possessions or social status.
