# Focus and discipline

What is the scarcest commodity in the 21st century? Is it gold? Silver? Platinum? 
No. 
It’s focus. It’s the ability to focus in a world inundated with information and social media that is designed to 
(as the creators of one major social media platform admitted to publicly) keep us as addicted and distracted as 
possible. 

It’s no joke. The ability to focus is a serious problem that is important to understand and overcome. 
Why? 

### The Focus and Happiness Link
Research shows that your happiness is dependent upon it. In the article When the Mind Wanders, Happiness also Strays,
author John Tierney reports on the research by Daniel Gilbert and Matthew Killingsworth. The New York Times summed 
up the research saying, 
“Whatever people were doing, whether it was having sex or reading or shopping, they tended to be happier if they 
focused on the activity instead of thinking about something else.”
The bottom line? 
Your happiness and your ability to accomplish your goals is getting silently and not so silently attacked by 
distractions… 

### The High Cost of Distraction

In another important article in the New York Times entitled Brain, Interrupted by Bob Sullivan and Hugh Thompson, 
research at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University shows that the average office 
worker gets distracted every 3 minutes. 
Every 3 minutes!
But here’s the important point they make…
It takes 25 minutes just to regain focus after being distracted!
This is why getting distracted is so frustrating to those of us who experience it. We intuitively know how 
detrimental it is to progress, but many others have a hard time understanding why. Now, you can tell them why! 
To be mentally present, you have to avoid distractions at all costs. 

### Why Distractions Win

Here’s the real problem according to the above-noted research… 
Distractions trigger our fight/flight response. We can’t help it. It is the natural reaction of our brains to 
danger. So, when you hear a loud, unfamiliar noise, our brains say something like, “This book we are working 
on is not important! This loud noise could be dangerous!” Or “This software program that we are working on 
isn’t nearly as important as what could be a potential threat to our very existence!” 
It doesn’t matter if the distraction is a noise or a co-worker/employee entering our cubicle/office with a 
question – a distraction is a distraction, and it will take you 25 minutes to get back on track! What a waste of 
productivity… 
This fight/flight response is programmed into us for our survival’s sake. There are times when this primal part 
of our brains could save our lives. If there was an explosion, or if you smelled smoke or heard a crash in the 
other room because your cat knocked over a pot of boiling water, it warrants your attention…
What else is important to know about our brains?

### Brain Focus Hacks

This brain of ours, when in a regular schedule sleep pattern, handles difficult brain tasks best in the late morning, from about 10 am to noon. After that, we are susceptible to distraction from noon to about 4 pm. So, schedule your toughest tasks for the day in the late morning time and take a break or just go for a walk in the afternoon if you can. Write down the specific goal that you want to accomplish, preferably the night before, and then work on it in the morning. 
How can you enhance your ability to focus when your mind wanders? 
Some experts recommend that you first recognize when you have been distracted. Next, focus on your breathing. Then, let the train of thought that got you off track leave your thoughts by continuing to focus on your breath. Don’t change your breathing pattern – just notice it, let the distracting thoughts go, and then get back to your important task.
To focus better, exercise in the form of yoga is excellent too. Meditation is a great way to get more grounded and centered so that you don’t allow yourself to get distracted. 
The first step is awareness. Start monitoring how many times you get distracted in your day, so you know if it’s a problem or not. 
Some think that the goal should be to work 8 hours straight without any interruption, but studies have shown that at around 20 to 25 minutes of straight work, most of us need a mental break. This is why the new idea is to work for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. 
Of course, do what you think is best for you. Add or subtract the time limits to suit yourself best. 
You can even get apps that will help you to stay focused but the most important thing is to recognize when it happens and take action to limit it. If it is a boss, a co-worker, a friend of a family member who interrupts you too much, kindly explain to them to not disturb you unless necessary. You could even tell them that you work in 25-minute increments and ask them to not disturb you during that time. 
And if it is your email, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or any other social media app that is the problem, take steps to limit your engagement with them. Set aside a specific time to use them and don’t let them interrupt you when you’re working on an important task. 
The good news is that the more that you work to master focus, the easier it will become. It is like anything else – the more your exercise your focus muscle, the better.
