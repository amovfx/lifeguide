# Focus and discipline

Like anything these can be honed.

You have 2 3 hour bursts of intense focus a day.

Decide what you want and be specific

Write down your specific goal

Set a date by which you think you could accomplish it. Be realistic. If itâ€™s large break it down into sub deadlines.

Write down a list of everythin you could possibly do to achieve your goal. Include obstacles and the additional list of skills and knowledge you will need to achieve it.

Prioritize the mist beneficial tasks and add them to your calendar. Most important should be completed first.

Start taking on your tasks right waway.

DO something everyday that helps you achieve your goal.
