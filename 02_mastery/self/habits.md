# Habits

Habits are the key to your success, they save you time and free up your brainpower to focus on longer term goals.
What we want to do is to learn about habits, how they work and how to build them. The problem that we have, is identifying and awknowledging bad habits and working to replace them.

Habits are simple cue-routine-reward loops that are stored in the basal ganglia, specifically the stratium.

A cue is an external stimulus that causes a spike in your brain.

A routine is the set of actions that the basal ganglia picks to get it’s reward.

A reward is the feeling of success form completing the activity. The accompanying spike in brain activity reinforces the link between cue and routine.

### Changing Habits

Habits are incredibly resilient and can operate even if your brain is severely damaged.

Habit’s can’t be stopped. They can only be replaced.

To change, recognize the cue, replace the old routine with another and believe in the change.

Keystone habits are small habits that stack up to have a larger impact on your life.

It takes about 40 days to cement a habit.

Steady progress and patience will get you where you want to be.

Start by creating very small habits. Like making your bed first thing in the morning and build from there.
Doing so builds momentum.

If you want to start a habit, attach it to current one you have. Starting to read while you exercise.

If you would like to start a habit, work to reduce the ‘activation time’. It should be under 20 seconds.

If you would like to end a habit, increase the ‘activation time’ of the activity.

### Habits aren't just for people

Groups such as corporations, societies and cultures have habits as well.

Habits of organizations can be dangerous but can be changed in times of crisis.
Strong social group ties combined with peer pressure and new habits can start a movement.

Habits are simple cue-routine-rward loops that save effort. 
Cue is a spike in your brain from an external source as your brain decides which habit is appropriate for the situation.
Routine - The activity your used to performing when faced with a particular cue. 
Reward - The feeling of success, you get  a spike in brain activity as you register the completion of the activity that reinforces the link between the cue and the routine.

Habits are incredibly resilient. They are stored in the basal ganglia, a small neurological structure deep in the brain. It can operate even if other parts of the brain are damaged.

Habits stick because they create craving.
To change a habit, substitute the routine for another and believe in the change.
Change can be achieved by cofusing on keystone habits and acheieing small wins.
Willpower is the most important keystone habit. Look up the marshmellow test.
Organizational habits can be dangerous, but a crisis can change them.
Companies take advantage of habits in their marketing. Target example. Most people turn right as they enter department stores.
Movements are born from strong ties, peer pressure and new habits.
WE BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CHANGING OUR HABITS.

Following habits is not only a key part of our lives but also a key part of organizations and companies. All habits comprise of a cue-routine-reward loop and the easiest way to change this is to substitute something else for the routine while keeping the cue and reward the same, Achieveing lasting change in life is difficult, but it can be done by focusing on important keystone habits such as will power.

Actionable advice: Make your bed every morning. Science shows that this can increase your well being and boost your overall productivity. Habits are built on top of each other.
