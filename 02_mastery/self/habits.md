# Habits

Habits are the key to your success; they save you time and free up your brainpower to focus on longer-term goals. 
What we want to do is to learn about habits, how they work and how to build the good ones into your daily routine. 
The problem that we have is identifying and acknowledging bad habits and working to replace them.

Habits are simple cue-routine-reward loops that save effort. A cue is a spike or trigger in your brain from an 
external source as your brain decides which habit is appropriate for the situation. Routine is the activity 
you’re used to performing when faced with a particular cue. The reward is the feeling of success; you get a 
spike in brain activity as you register the completion of the activity that reinforces the link between the 
cue and the routine.

Habits are incredibly resilient. They are stored in the basal ganglia, a small neurological structure deep in 
the brain. It can operate even if other parts of the brain are damaged. In other words, habits can’t be stopped. 
They can only be replaced.

### Changing Habits

To change a bad habit, you must recognize the cue or routine and then replace the old routine with a good habit. 
But also, you must first believe that the change is important, and then show grit and determination to change. 

Keystone habits are small habits that stack up to have a larger impact on your life. You are the sum of your small,
daily habits and that is why it’s so important to make sure they are good ones. 
It used to be said that it only takes 21 days to create a good habit. Some said 30. Others said 40. 
But the University College London’s research shows that it takes quite a bit longer than originally thought. 
66 Days to Change

Their research revealed that it takes an average of 66 days for a person to develop a good habit. 
They also found a large deviation between the clinical trial participants – some took only about 10 days to 
form a good habit, and some over 250 days. The point is that you shouldn’t aim for a certain number of days, 
but instead, commit to permanently keep the good habit no matter how long it takes. 
Steady progress and patience will get you where you want to be…

Start by creating very small habits. There are many good books out there on how to create mini habits. 
The idea is simple…

### The Power of Mini Habits

Don’t worry about progress – instead, make the goal to create the good habit first, and then work to 
improve the good habit. In the book “Mini Habits: Smaller Habits, Bigger Results,” Stephen Guise talks 
about this. He says that if you want to do push-ups every day, make it your goal to do only one! The focus 
of the goal, in the beginning, is to create the good habit first. By setting your expectations super low, 
you’ll do the goal and develop the good habit. Then, before you know it, you’ll be “hooked” in a good way 
and you’ll be doing 10, 20, or 30+ push-ups every day. This idea of just doing one push-up works well for 
when you don’t feel like doing push-ups at all, if you are sick, or don’t have the time. If your goal is only 
one, you’ll still be able to do it. 

### Start Your Day Right

How many of us get up without making our beds, only to sometimes go back to bed realizing that we never made 
it up all day long? Since it must be done anyway, why don’t we get into the habit of making it right after 
getting up? It’s a great way to discipline yourself to get into good habits, and it builds momentum for the rest 
of your day. 

Another suggestion to develop good habits is to attach them to a current one you have. For example, 
if you already get on a treadmill every day and you want to develop the good habit of reading a book, 
plop that book on your treadmill and do both at once. 

### Make the Habit Easy to Start

Still, another suggestion to start a good habit is to work to reduce the “activation time.” The habit activation 
time means the amount of time it takes for you to start the habit. It should be under 20 seconds.
Shawn Anchor, in his book “The Happiness Advantage,” says that the less “activation time” that it 
takes you to start and complete your good habit, the better. And he says that the more activation time 
that it takes to start and complete your bad habit, the better…

For example, Shawn wanted to get into the good habit of learning to play his guitar. But he found that he 
just couldn’t get himself to do it. What he realized was that the real problem was that he didn’t have quick 
and easy access to get to his guitar. He timed it and it took him an extra 20 seconds just to get his guitar 
from its stored location and start playing. 

To solve the problem, he put his guitar in a strategic location with easy and quick access. When he did that, 
it was easy for him to develop that good habit. 

### Make the Bad Habit Hard to Start

Conversely, he wanted to stop the bad habit of watching too much TV. So, what he did was he took the batteries 
out of the TV remote and placed them in a location where it would take him more than 20 seconds of activation 
time to get to them. 

He would forget that he did this, pick up the remote, and try to turn the TV on. When it didn’t turn on, 
because he knew it would take him time and energy to replace the batteries, he would not watch TV. Bad habit 
stopped easily! 

In other words, make it easy as possible to start good habits, and make it difficult to continue the bad ones… 



### Habits aren't just for people

Groups such as corporations, societies, and cultures have habits as well. Some of them could be good, and some of 
them could be bad. 
Habits of organizations can be dangerous but can be changed in times of crisis. Strong social group ties combined 
with peer pressure and new habits can start a movement.
Companies take advantage of habits in their marketing. Most people turn right as they enter department stores. 
Movements are born from strong ties, peer pressure, and new habits. WE BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CHANGING OUR 
HABITS.

Achieving lasting change in life is difficult, but it can be done by focusing on important keystone habits such 
as willpower.
Actionable Advice: Make your bed every morning. Science shows that this can increase your well-being and boost 
your overall productivity. Habits are built on top of each other.
