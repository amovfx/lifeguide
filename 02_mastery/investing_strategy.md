# My Investment strategies

I have had a 80% return year over year since 2012.
I formulate a strategy based off of knowledge of history, psychology and technology.
The internet has allowed people to connect and cooperate in new ways that has
brought massive disruption to major industries. This would be expected if we look at history. 

Whenever humans have developed a new way to record data, it has had far reaching impacts to our civilization.

The invention of writing, cuniform, wasn't quite like the writing we know today. It wasn't able to describe abstractions that would enalbe poetry or a novel. It was a script that enable contract law and most importantly ledgers.

This transformation enabled trade and for humanity to form into cities. It allowed for the transformation into a nomadic civilization into an agrarian one.

As histroy progressed, we developed new ways of storeing and disseminating data. Language became more complex which allowed for religions to proliferate, as well as nation states.

The printing press, radio, tv, computers, databases, internet, blogs like instagram and facebook. All have had monumental transformations upon our civilization.

Now we are at another one, as anyone reading understands, the computing and internet disrupted almost every industrial sectors, all except one industry.
Finance. The internet was missing a key piece of the puzzle which would enable it to disrupt the finance and regulatory industries.
It was impossible to send money through the internet without a trusted third party. If you wanted to send money, you had to use a bank. This is because banks
are in control of a process called settlement. Settelment is the process that balances two seperate ledgers. This maintains
a stable monetary supply so the economy doesn't blow up.

Bitcoin is what solved this problem. It is the first time we are enabled to do settlement without a third party.

So when we look back at history, we can see a very large shift in how we organize when we get a new way to record data.
Bitcoin is a network that enforces a distributed ledger. We have never had this and it was long sought
to be impossible. THere are numerous papers proving distributed consensus is impossible. THis changed with bitcoin.
Not so much through a break through in computer science, its a bunch of computer security protocols put together, but a very clever understandign and application of
game theory. 

So when we look back at bitcoin's history, we see that it has out performed everything. It is the fastest
asset to 1 trillion valuation, through 2010-2020 is had a return of 1.5 million percent.
The second prize would go to netflix with a measly 4000% return. Bitcoin's performance is so good
that their really isn't any reason to invest in anything else.

So lets discuss the risks. There is a lot of alt coins out there. How do we screen for these?
Investing in this space is rife in scams so we have to look for a couple properties.

THe first property is open source. If you cant see what a crypto is doing under the hood it is a 
high probability of a security vunerability at best, and a scam at worst.

Next, we look at the amount and quality of volunteers on the project. The activity of commits to the software 
should be visible. We want to see what the kind of talent that the project attracts.
Is this worth a world class engineers free time? Bitcoin has seemed to capture the imagination
of quite a few.

The last property is the coin distribution. The supply should be capped. Inflation should be handled by the 
divisibility of the coins. A bitcoin is a hundred million units.

So before we decide to buy it, we need to understand that bitcoin is a data transfer protocol before it is money. 
Software  is constantly improving.

WHen our first internet was created it started out as ethernet, ethernet is a broadcast network, 
it doesnt scale, every node on the network communicates with every other node when a request is made.
So our early internet had scaling issues much like bitcoin does with it's 7 transactions per second capacity.

To get around the ethernets scalability issues, TCP/IP was made as a routing layer which underpins
our modern internet today. Bitcoin's scalability is being addressed in the same fashion. The lightning network
is a routing protocol for bitcoin. It enables near free, instant transactions, with approximatley 3.2 
million tps.

Current Lightning Stats.

A problem with aseessing bitcoins value is that it is commonly precieved as a currency or a commodity.
These are abstractions of utility. ##Explain what a currency is.

When we look at bitcoin as a network, we can start to understand what value and opportunities it
brings humanity. We can now do commerce without a trusted third party. Thats the entire financial
sector. Bitcoin will be making short work of our largest most profitable industry that has ever existed
and has enabled our way of life through global commerce and trade. If that isn't enough, its introdued
competition to the nation states with their central banks for monetary policy.

THe next is how it revolutionizes computing. The lightning network is an internet. Data can be packaged with
payments. This allows the disruption of the FANGM. Cloud computing and storage can now be decentralized
through protocols like IPFS, data can remain private, its use bought and sold by the individual through micro
payments. A new market of digital property is enabled. Atomic Swaps roll up the entire forex market which we
are seeing with strike app.

So when you own bitcoin, you don't own a speculative curency own a piece of the next generation internet.

My other strategy is squeezing over extended Hedge funds on short positions like Gamestop. Lol.
