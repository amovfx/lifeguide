# My Investment strategies

I have had a 80% return year over year since 2012.
I formulate a strategy based off of knowledge of history, psychology and technology.
The internet has allowed people to connect and cooperate in new ways that has
brought massive disruption to major industries. This would be expected if we look at history. 

Whenever humans have developed a new way to record data, it has had far reaching impacts to our civilization.

The invention of writing, cuniform, wasn't quite like the writing we know today. It wasn't able to describe abstractions that would enalbe poetry or a novel. It was a script that enable contract law and most importantly ledgers.

This transformation enabled trade and for humanity to form into cities. It allowed for the transformation into a nomadic civilization into an agrarian one.

As histroy progressed, we developed new ways of storeing and disseminating data. Language became more complex which allowed for religions to proliferate, as well as nation states.

The printing press, radio, tv, computers, databases, internet, blogs like instagram and facebook. All have had monumental transformations upon our civilization.

Now we are at another one, as anyone reading understands, the computing and internet disrupted almost every industrial sectors, all except one industry.
Finance. The internet was missing a key piece of the puzzle which would enable it to disrupt the finance and regulatory industries.
It was impossible to send money through the internet without a trusted third party. If you wanted to send money, you had to use a bank. This is because banks
are in control of a process called settlement. Settelment is the process that balances two seperate ledgers. This maintains
a stable monetary supply so the economy doesn't blow up.

Bitcoin is what solved this problem. It is the first time we are enabled to do settlement without a third party.
