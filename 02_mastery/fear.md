Fear prevents change. When you are afraid, your lower lembic system becomes activated
which uses the nutrients from the blood which deprives your cerbral cortex of
what it needs to function.

Change ingnites fear. And if you are changing you are going to need good fear management 
techniques so you can use your higher level brain functions to shape your life into what you want.

Stress doesn't exist, you dont have stress neurons. There is only fear. Don't let it hold you back
from becoming want you want to be.
