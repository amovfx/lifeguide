# Fear and Failure

Fear is a powerful emotion that under the right circumstances can benefit us. For example, if you were caught 
in a forest fire and you needed to run to safety, fear could give you a boost of energy to run fast enough to 
\escape. Your brain would dump a lot of adrenalin and cortisol into your system to give you that extra boost of 
energy. 

When you are afraid, your lower limbic system becomes activated which uses the nutrients from your blood which 
deprives your cerebral cortex of what it needs to function. Also, your blood flow is directed to your extremities
to take instant physical action. This is why when you are in a state of fear or anger you cannot think as clearly 
as normal. 

For most of us, fear shows up in lots of other areas in our lives besides running from forest fires and 
saber-toothed tigers and offers no benefit. For example, most of us are fearful of public speaking. The 
problem is that our brain’s response to running from a forest fire or public speaking is the same. One is a 
legitimate fear that helps, and the other is an unfounded fear that doesn’t help.

### Unfounded Fear Roots

In every case of unfounded fear, there is an event from the past that caused it to take root. For example, if when you were 10 years old you had to give a speech in class, but you did poorly, your subconscious mind might try to convince you that you are not a good public speaker, so it would want you to avoid public speaking next time. And then if a couple of years later in life you had to give another speech and did poorly again, your subconscious mind would cement those neural pathways into your brain and convince you for sure that you’re not a good public speaker since you messed up public speaking twice in a row.  
Then, if you did nothing to change that unfounded fear and belief that you’re not a good public speaker, when you get into adulthood, you would likely have the same fear of public speaking. 

But the problem is that it was your childhood brain and mind that decided such an important thing. It wasn’t a rational, cognitive unbiased decision by your adult mind. For this reason, we should challenge all the negative beliefs and fears that we have from our adult mindset – not the childhood one. 

### How to Master Unfounded Fears

If you have an unfounded fear, such as claustrophobia, public speaking, or spiders, ask yourself when you first got the fear. Then challenge it. Talk to yourself in a logical way that sets your mind at ease relative to the fear. What you want to do is to reprogram your subconscious mind using logic and reasoning to calm its fears. 

Change can also ignite fear. So, if you are changing, you are going to need good fear management techniques so you can use your higher-level brain functions to shape your life into what you want.
Make a Disaster Report
Face your fears immediately and put them into your own personal disaster report. This is a basic risk assessment concept that anyone can use. Here are the steps:
Describe your fear clearly.
Determine your worst-case scenario. 
Write it down.
Find a solution to the worst-case scenario.
Do everything in your power to avoid the worst-case scenario.

Mastering Failure

Failure has gotten such a bad rap. It starts in school. All of us are graded on a scale from A to F, where F stands for failure. It’s the worst level a person could be. And so, the educational system has brainwashed and conditioned us to believe that failing at anything at any time is a catastrophe. 
And yet, failure is such an integral part of life!
Think about a baby taking her first steps…
When she steps and falls, do you call her a failure? Does she think she’s a failure? 
Not at all…
She tries and tries again until she can walk. 
And yet, technically speaking, she failed over and over again before she could walk.

Failure as the Way

Failure is part of the journey to success. Failure is inevitable and is a critical part of moving forward.
But also, failure opens up new opportunities. When one door closes, another one is open. 
Learning from failure is instrumental to success. What if Einstein had given up the instant that his first experiment failed? What if the Wright brothers gave up on the idea of flying when it first didn’t work? When you try something that doesn’t work, now you know what doesn’t work! It’s simple common sense. 
Overcoming the fear of failure and learning to take new risks brings long-term success. It’s the fear of failure that gets to so many of us, and that is an unfounded fear that is usually based upon our experience in the “failed” educational system. They didn’t prepare us for real life! 
Failure is also a discovery of a competence and knowledge boundary. It will highlight for you what you are good at, what you are not, and how much knowledge you have about the subject matter at hand.  It will let you know when you need to know more. And there’s nothing wrong with trying something new and failing at it. How else are you going to learn? 
So much of it is about mindset. The fear of failure can keep you from many wonderful experiences in life simply because you were afraid to try. 
Don’t ever be afraid to try anything that you are even the least bit curious about. That is the joy of life. Try it, fail, and then try again until you get it. 
That is the process of life!
