# Financial Management

This is one of the most important chapters. Now that you know how to create an autonomous mindset, 
know how to create good habits, focus on what is important, get past fear and failure, know how to master 
time and how to master goals, now comes one of the most important topics: MONEY. 

### Pay Yourself First
First, to gain financial mastery, you must get into the habit of paying yourself first with any income that 
you earn from any income stream. That means saving money with every paycheck or other source of income into an 
account that you never touch.

Also, once you get a nest egg in place, get a safety net under you which will reduce your fear and allow you to 
take risks. If you don’t save while you earn, you’ll never be able to get your money to work for you. 
Start with saving 1% of your gross income and increase it from there.  Practice saving more and spending less. 
Give up trying to keep up with the Joneses or buying things to impress anyone. Be frugal so that later you’ll 
have a nice nest egg in place. 

To motivate yourself to save, think about what you value. Is it travel? Is it financial independence? Visualize 
yourself already having what you want, and your subconscious mind will work to make it come true. 
Regarding financial goals, you don’t have to try to figure out exactly what it should be. You can even guess what 
your goals should be and then fine-tune the goal as you go. Your goals are not set in stone. 
Another point is to make sure that you know where you are now financially. Assess your current financial situation 
\by making a balance sheet of assets and liabilities. When you have a clear picture of where you are, you can then 
make realistic financial goals. 

### Budget

Also, it’s a great idea to make a budget so that you can track your spending. Do a little research to find the 
best budgeting app you can or use the envelope system where you mark envelopes with things such as “Entertainment” 
or “Eating Out.” Then, put cash in each envelope with the budgeted amounts at the beginning of the month and then 
only use that cash for that category. When you run out for the month, that’s it for that activity until next month. 
Make a budget and track your spending. Save as much as you can and view paying off debts as a form of investment. 
For example, if your highest interest credit card is 25% and you have a savings account that pays only 3%, it 
doesn’t make any sense to have ANY balance amount on the 25% credit card. Pay that off first and do your best to 
never carry a balance on high-interest credit cards. Always pay off the debt you have which has the highest amount 
of interest first. 
And don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your investments to protect yourself from drastic economic 
fluctuations.
