# Financial Management

This is probably the most important section. You pay yourself first.

Start with saving 1% of your gross income and increase it from there. Practise saving more and spending less.


Define what you value, financial independence or travel for example.

Guess what your goals are and fine tune them as you go. They arenâ€™t set in stone.

Assess  your current financial situation by making a balance sheet of assets and liabilities.

Make a budget to track spending.

Save as much as you can and view paying off debts as a form of investment.

Diversify your investments.
