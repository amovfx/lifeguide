# Time management

In today’s world, we are inundated with emails, social media, messages, and zoom calls. These are all distractions and as you have learned, just one distraction can derail your concentration. It then usually takes 25 minutes to get back on track with your important task. These things break our flow and we run the risk of context switching, making you less productive.
Your brain is terrible at remembering things. Your short-term memory only holds 5 to 6 things. This is why you need to make sure you have the right tools to capture all your tasks, ideas, and reminders. 
There are many tools out there to manage and master your time. One of the best ones is by productivity consultant David Allen and it is called Getting Things Done, or the GTD method for short. 

### The GTD Method

The goal of the GTD Method is to improve your productivity by putting all your personal and professional to-do 
tasks in one inbox so that you don’t have to spend energy and time remembering them. Then, it’s a matter of 
categorizing everything that you place in your physical or digital in-box into projects and tasks. 
When you implement this system, it frees up your brain width. You can only have so many things on your mind at 
once. When you optimize for this, you have more mental energy for creative work which takes the bulk of your 
mental horsepower.

The idea is that to maximize creativity, you need to get all your ideas and plans out of your head and down on paper. 
This system is not dependent upon either a digital or a paper system. It works either way and can even work 
together with both. 

Included in the GTD Method is review. Being aware of your job goals and current tasks will enable you to make 
good decisions about the work to come.
These tactics help you prepare for difficulties and interruptions ahead of time and being well organized allows 
you to achieve more in less time.
However, the GTD Method is best when you have a lot of projects and a lot of tasks to track. It can be overkill 
if you don’t have many tasks to complete. This is a balancing act; you don’t want to overdo it to the point where 
attempting to keep track of your tasks takes you longer than simply doing them. It all depends upon if you have a 
light workload, or not. 

Part of the GTD Method is that to reach your long-term goals, you need to translate them into short-term action 
steps. Once you get good at this, you can spread these ideas to your team to improve communication.
To fully implement the GTD system, you need the right workplace, tools, and filing system. Make sure your 
workspaces at work and home are identical. Purge your system once a year so that it doesn’t become a bloated mess. 
Capture all your tasks, ideas and reminders, and more in trusted external collections tools. You could use a 
filing cabinet, a notebook, a journal, an app on your phone, or any combination of these and more. 
The next step is to clarify. The goal is to empty all your external collection tools (your virtual or physical 
in-box) weekly into categories so that everything is handled. 
The next step is to organize. Empty your collection tools and put things in the right place. If something 
takes more than one action, it is a project. It then goes on the project’s list. If it is a single action 
that you can delegate, it should go on a “waiting for” list. 
A single action that you defer goes onto the calendar or a next action list. Calendar is meant for time-specific 
or date-specific actions or information. Next action lists are where all your to-dos end up. Split these lists 
up based on context. If something is not actionable but you may need to do something about it, it goes on the 
someday/maybe list. If you come across interesting information that will be useful later, it goes onto a 
reference material list.

Use project lists to keep track of your current projects and always insist on clear next actions. Review these 
lists every week and make sure that each project has a clear concrete next step. Make your next actions as 
specific as possible.
Natural planning clarifies the goals and next concrete steps for your projects. Instead of dealing with to-do 
lists, maintain a calendar and next action lists. “Waiting for” lists can be very helpful when you work with 
other people. All ideas with potential future relevance should go to the someday lists. 
Another important step is to reflect. When you constantly review your system, it becomes indispensable to working 
productively. 
And still another step is to engage. Choose what to do in each moment based on the current situation and your 
priorities. This is where you consider the context, time available, the energy available, and priority regarding 
a task. What can you do in the current context? What do you have time for? What do you have energy for? Which 
task is the highest priority?
When you use this system successfully, you will have more time in life to do the things that you want to do such 
as learn languages, take trips, etc. 

### The ABCDE Method

The GTD Method is great for getting tasks done, but it doesn’t prioritize them. This is why you need the ABCDE 
method. It prioritizes your tasks. 
The idea comes from the book “Eat that Frog!” by Brian Tracy. Mark Twain came up with that catchy phrase to mean 
that if you ate a frog first thing in the morning, everything you did after that point would be easy. 
Productivity gurus like Brian Tracy used this idea to apply it to tasks. 
In other words, start your day with your most urgent, difficult task first. When you complete that one, do 
the next one that is the most urgent or highest priority. But there is a difference between urgent and important. 
Start with the most urgent tasks that you must do, but also, make sure to work on your most important yet NOT 
urgent tasks. This concept was taught by another productivity guru Stephen Covey. In other words, some things 
are urgent but not important, and some things are not urgent, but important. You need to focus more on the “not 
urgent, but important” tasks and give them the daily attention that they need. An example would be, writing your 
book or learning a new skill or learning how to make money online or learning a new language, etc.  
The premise of the ABCDE method is easy. “A” tasks are the highest priority, followed by “B,” then “C.” “D” 
stands for “Delegate,” and “E” stands for “Eliminate.” Here is a more detailed description:
“A” tasks: Must do tasks that have major consequences if not completed.
“B” tasks: Should do tasks with mild consequences if not completed.
“C” tasks: Least important, nice to do tasks with no consequences.
Within the “A” tasks, you can prioritize them using numbers starting with 1 being the top priority. So, 
“A1” would be the highest priority. “A2” would be next and slightly lower priority than “A1,” and so on. 
Then you do the same thing for the “B” tasks. “B1,” “B2,” “B3,” etc. 
Delegate (D) tasks to others to free yourself for your “A” tasks and Eliminate (E) any task that you can 
for the same reason – to free yourself up for those important “A” tasks. 
If you are doing something that isn't moving towards your goal, you have to stop. You need to recognize 
distractions for what they are. Distractions can cause you dearly in the long run, but with the GTD and 
ABCDE methods, you can easily know what task you should work on next.
