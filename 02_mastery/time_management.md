#Time Management

How are we going to use our time for our priorities?
Your brain is terrible at remembering things. Short term memory holds 5-6 things.
Make sure you have the right tools to capture all tasks, ideas and reminders.
Empty your collection tools weekly and clarify.
Organize, everything should have its place.
If something takes more than one action it is a project and it goes on the project list.
If something can be delegated, it goes on the waiting for list.
Calendar is meant for time and date specific actions.
Next action lists are where all your todos end up. Split these lists based on contexts. These should be as specific as possible.

### Time Engagement

Choose what to do for the current situation and priorities.

What can you do in the current context?

Do you have enough time?

What is your energy level for the task at hand?

What task is the highest priority?

Should do tasks. Mild consequences if uncomplete.

Nice to do tasks with no consequences.

Tasks that can be delegated.

Tasks that are getting in the way and need to be eliminated.

If you are doing something that isn't moving yourself towards your goal, you have to stop. You need to recognize distractions for what they are.
