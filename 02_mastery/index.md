# Mastery

In this chapter we focus on building good habits that focus on our time and energy management.
The key is first master ourselves before we master our environment.

We want to pay close attention to our health, with a focus on sleep, exercise and diet.

The rule of thumb is, if you don't not invest the time, you do not achieve your goals.
