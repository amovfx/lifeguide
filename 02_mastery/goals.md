# Goals

Time mastery and goal mastery are very similar, but we will focus only on goal setting in this short chapter.
Goal mastery and management are best accomplished by categorizing goals into levels. Current projects and tasks to be completed generate level 1 tasks. Accountabilities, personal growth, health, finances, socialization, family, and planning generate level 2 tasks. Yearly goals generate level 3 tasks. A long-term vision such as where you want to be in 3 to 5 years, and career aspirations generate level 4 tasks. Life’s purpose or why do you exist generates level 5 tasks.

### How to Create Goals

To create a goal, establish a vision of the end goal before you begin. Then, write it down and make sure that 
it is specific. For example, the goal of “Write my book” is too general. But “Write 500 words in my book every 
day” is specific. 
Next, set a date by which you think you can accomplish your goal. Be realistic. If it is large, break it down into 
milestones with sub-deadlines. 
Next, write down a list of everything you could do to achieve your goal. Include obstacles and the additional 
list of skills and knowledge you will need to achieve it. In our example of writing your book, let’s say that 
your obstacle was that you simply don’t have peace, quiet, and the time you need to write your book. The solution 
may be to write down a sub-goal of getting up half an hour early every morning so you can write your 500 words in 
your book every day. 
And if you needed more knowledge to get your book published, in this example, then another goal would be to study 
how to self-publish your book. 
Prioritize your most beneficial tasks and then add them to your calendar. The most important goals should be 
completed first, according to the ABCDE Method. 
Start working on your tasks right away. Do something every day that helps you achieve your goals. At the very 
least, sit down and look at your tasks. This is the non-zero-day concept.

### Get into the Flow

It will feel genuinely good to you when you have a clear vision of your goals, use the GTD and ABCDE Methods to 
organize and prioritize your goals, and then execute on them. When you stick to it and discipline yourself enough 
to follow the systems described, you will get into the “flow state” where you feel like you are “in the zone.” 
It’s a great feeling because you will feel like you are in a state of action and awareness and that you are 
making good progress every day towards your dreams and goals. 

Flow state can be triggered by challenging yourself to learn as much as you can about your job or surpass your 
performance. And language and memory games can trigger flow state.
The other thing that you can do is to develop new and interesting skills using these methods. Another method to 
keep you motivated and inspired is to tie your challenges to personal rewards. Reward yourself with dinner out, 
a massage, or even just a nice drive when you make a milestone or finish a goal. 
Remember that the tasks that you choose to create shouldn’t be too difficult or too easy. 
If it is too difficult or too easy, delegate it. If it is outside of your knowledge boundary, delegate it. 
You need to be able to do your tasks with sustained effort. 
Turn your progress into a habit and you will have mastered goal setting.
