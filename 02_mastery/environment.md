#Environment

We are products of our environment.

Your brain can only focus on a limited amount of stimuli at a time.

Set a designated place for every single object.

Organize your ideas outside of your head to conserve mental energy.

Set aside time to refuel and organize your environment for long term time savings.

Your working environment must be clear of any distractions.

You must have your input and output collections tools for managing information.

Your seperate working environments should match. Your environment at work should match your home environment office.
