# Excersize

Exercise promotes better sleep. Sleep promotes better energy and willpower. Your diet, sleep, 
and exercise are intertwined. When you build good habits here, you build a virtuous feedback 
cycle and some serious momentum.

Exercise is the foundation of your habits and sleep. It replenishes your brainâ€™s cerebrospinal 
fluid which is a liquid that nourishes your neurons. Also, according to new research, exercise 
maintains our mental health as we age, and it reduces the chance of depression. In addition, 
exercise causes micro-tears in your muscles which triggers the release of testosterone and 
HGH which promotes healthy, rejuvenating sleep.
One of the best ways to get enough exercise is to choose something that you enjoy doing. Set goals and track your progress.
