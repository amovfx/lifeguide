# Sleep

A quick guide to sleep hygiene so you can perform at your highest capacity.

Sleep deprivation deprives the brain’s glucose content. Which fuels grey matter in the areas that deal with problem solving and high level thinking.

Get sunlight between 6 am and 8 am. This triggers a wake up call to your brains, other organs and glands.

Sleep in pitch black. Light at night suppresses melatonin by up to 50%. No screens 1 hour before bed. 

Timing, go to bed within 30 minutes every night. This regulates our internal bio-clock. No work in the bedroom. 

Get up early, we are evolved to be active during the day.

10pm and 2pm is when our peak production from melatonin and other hormones peak.

Caffeine has a half life of 8 hours. You need to flush it before you can rest.

Alcohol prevents entering REM, the stage responsible for memory processing.

Magnesium is responsible for 300 biochemical reactions for your body and calms the nervous system, balances blood sugar levels, optimizes blood pressure and relaxes muscles. Meditate regularly. 

Make where you sleep a sanctuary of peace. English Ivy is the best air filtering plant. “Mother in Law’s tongue” converts Co2 to oxygen at night.
