# Sleep

You need good sleep to perform at your highest capacity. Sleep deprivation deprives the brain’s glucose content which fuels grey matter in the areas that deal with problem-solving and high-level thinking.
The following are sleep tips:
Get sunlight between 6 am and 8 am. This triggers a wake-up call to your brain, other organs, and glands.
Sleep in pitch black. Light at night suppresses melatonin by up to 50%. Turn all screens (TV, cell phone, computer screen) off 1 hour before bed.
Timing; go to bed at the same time within 30 minutes every night. This regulates our internal bio-clock. 
Do not work in the bedroom.
Get up early, we are evolved to be active during the day.
10 pm and 2 pm is when we have our peak production from melatonin and other hormones peak.
Caffeine has a half-life of 8 hours. You need to flush it before you can rest.
Alcohol prevents entering REM, the stage responsible for memory processing. Eliminate or limit your alcohol intake. 
Magnesium optimizes blood pressure, relaxes muscles, balances blood sugar levels, calms the nervous system, and is responsible for 300 biochemical reactions in your body. 
Meditate regularly.
Make where you sleep a sanctuary of peace. English Ivy is the best air-filtering plant. “Mother in Law’s tongue” converts Co2 to oxygen at night.
