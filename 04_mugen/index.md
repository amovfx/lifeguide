#Mugen

When I was a young boy growing up in Canada( Looking at you Vlad), I was introduced to illustrated science fiction books that showed me what the world was going to be. They were paintings of a sustainable, diverse and peaceful future where people had time to live and express themselves. Work was automated and people had the luxury of time. The technology to build this future is now open source and freely available. I intend to build products that make the future I saw as a child a reality. For this future to come to fruition, people need a strong social safety net so they aren’t imprisoned by fear and can take risks to build a better and brighter future.

The for-profit health insurance industry in the United States is a crisis and dysfunctional. It is the most expensive in the world for time and money.

It is not acceptable that 
* 87 million americans are under insured or not insured. 
* 30k americas die a year because they avoid going to the doctor before it is too late. 
* 500k families are year driven to financial ruin due to a healthcare need. 
* People are dying because they can’t afford their prescription drugs. 
* Starting a small business is harder from exorbitant healthcare costs. 

All this suffering made the healthcare industry over 266 billion in profit and spent 519 million on lobbying in 2019.

We now have the technology to change that. Mugen is a platform that enables people to build and manage their own safety-social nets, by allowing people to cryptographically escrowing their money together for their collective best interest. Weather that be pets, computers, transportation, or health. This platform will reduce costs, save time, put the control of OUR money back in OUR hands and give participants a feeling of safety.

I cannot build these products alone. If you believe that humanity can build a better future for itself please join me.

This project is a public work project before it is anything else, I believe that the guiding principles that have brought me prosperity need to be freely available to everyone else. As a secondary effect, this document will be the foundational principles of the organization, it will be used to attract customers and talent.
