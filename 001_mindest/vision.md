# Vision

After you have made the decision that you can do anything, you must start visualizing the life you want to live.

The human brain isn't wired to think past one or two years from evolution of our development.
But like anything, this is something that can be practiced and learned.

Where do you want to be in 15-20 years.
Whhere do you have to be in 10?
Where do you have to be in 5?
Where do you have to be in 1?
Where do yo have to be next month?
Where do you have to be tommorow?

First we build the long view timelien and start breaking it down into manageable goals.
THis will help us identify what we need to start doing today.

THis doesn't have to be set in stone, it will change as you grow as a human being.

Every evening, write down what you would like to the next day and visualize your self doing it tommorow.
