# About this Author.

This is the accumulation of everything I've read and implimented successfully. There really isn't any
thing unique about this book. It's almost a summary of all the books I read, and there are a lot of great books out there.
What I'm attempting to do is bring all the ideas into a structure to show people where they can go,
then how to do it.

These ideas here are the foundation of the culture of the organizations that I am attempting to build.
I thought I would write this book to fullfill a couple of purposes.

Share the values and principles that benefited my life.
Help people achieve economic freedom from a corrupt system.
Recruit employees and customers.

I have the goal of building an organization that builds the world we were promised, a sustainable 
world
where the gains from automation are more evenly distributed instead of concentrated into the hands 
of the few.

THere is a lot of work, but we now have the tools to make a better world.
If you agree, join this slack.

#Credit to the actual writters.

I really just made the outline and hired professionals that knew what they are doing.

Here are the real heros that made this possible.
