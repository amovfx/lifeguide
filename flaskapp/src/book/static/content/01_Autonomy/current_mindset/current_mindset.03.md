[Psychometrics](./01_Autonomy/current_mindset/psychometrics.md) are a great way to start to 
 provide some quick insight into yourself but beware,
 these are the astrology of psychology. 
 They are pseudo-science rooted in a for profit motive. 
 However, they do provide insight into some human behaviors.
 
[Motivations]((./01_Autonomy/current_mindset/motivations.md)) are important to understand. 
What has been motivating you? If you don't understand this, 
eople can use this against you to manipulate you.
You must have control of your emotions. 

[Cognitive Biases](./01_Autonomy/current_mindset/cognitive_biases.md) We are unfortunatley our own worst enemy. 
We need to understand our weakness, if not we will be forever be bound by them.

Once we recognize these pitfalls, we have tools to label our emotions
and motives. None of these which we observe in ourselves are locked in stone.
Our personality is fluid and changes with time. This guide is meant to give
you the power to shape your own story and enable you to be who you want to be.
