# Welcome to the life guide!


The goal of this book is to provide a blueprint for success. It is a summary of over 100 self help books that I have read and applied.

This book's structure revolves around autonomy, mastery and purpose.

Autonomy is about getting your life under your control. Mastery is about choosing what to learn and continuous improvement. Purpose is about getting fulfillment by using your mastery to help others. 

My strengths are an understanding of history, psychology, economics and technology. I look to the past, to understand the present, to predict the future. This comes in handy with investing. I reached financial independence at 31. My investments average 90% return year over year since 2012. 

Success is often subjective and mine comes from evolutionary psychology. The fossil record goes back 178m years. The average mammalian species lives a million years before evolving or going extinct. We are 200 000 years old, collectively, we are an orphaned teenager. There isn't a parent civilization to guide us away from serious self harm. We spent about 188 000 years as nomadic tribes. Evolution rewarded survival to those that learned something that helped the group. This reinforced pro-social behavior over approximately 400 generations. Long story short, it feels good when I do good for my fellow human without expecting anything in return.When I do the opposite or nothing, I get a serving of anxiety and depression.

Presently, humanity is currently going through a revolution in communications, transport, and energy. When these three technologies converge it creates an industrial revolution. When these happen, our civilization reorganizes.

The future is a place of accelerated change. The internet will continue to expand into new industrial sectors. Cars will drive themselves and we will transition to a distributed green energy network. Humanity will continue to advance despite depleted resources, dying economies and climate change. After all, those are opportunities for us to grow as a species.

It is time for humanity to stop shitting where we eat. Responsibility comes before freedom and we must eat our vegetables.

My motivation for this book is to uplift as many people possible so we can navigate this change together. I am tremendously optimistic about our future. The extrinsic threat of climate change is a golden opportunity for humanity. We will unite behind singluar purpose of making ourselves and the planet better. 

The Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose formula has me waking up everyday excited and going to bed feeling accomplished.
