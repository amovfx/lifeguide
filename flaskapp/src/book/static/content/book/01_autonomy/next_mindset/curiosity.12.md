# Curiosity and Creativity

What is creativity? And can anyone become more creative? 
Some say that it is 1) The ability to “create” new ideas that address a problem that hasn’t been solved before and 2) The solution must work.

To explain it in more detail, in his book Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention, 
psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi defines creative people as:
People who seem stimulating, interesting, and have a variety of unusual thoughts.
People who perceive the world with a fresh perspective, have insightful ideas, and make important personal discoveries. These individuals make creative discoveries that are generally known only to them.
People who make great creative achievements that become known to the entire world. Inventors and artists such as Thomas Edison and Pablo Picasso would fall into this category.
Creative people embrace contradictions. They relish the creative thought it takes to ponder conflict in the world. They prefer to challenge tradition, traditional thought, and the idea that something must be done a certain way because that’s the way it’s always been done. Creative thinkers with a purpose are constantly looking for new, innovative ways to solve old problems. They are process improvement seekers and conquerors. 

Creative people allow their work to create the plan, rather than force a plan upon their work. The passion that they have for their work drives them to become masters. They usually become almost obsessed with their creative experience to the point where they call it a “rage to master.”  They have a need to engage in their work creatively and fully.

Some say that it is 1) The ability to “create” new ideas that save a problem and 2) The solution must work.

Creative people seem stimulating, interesting, and have a variety of unusual thoughts. They bring fresh perspective, gain insight, and make important personal discoveries. These individuals make creative discoveries that are generally known only to them.

Creative people embrace contradictions; relish in pondering the  conflicts of our world. They challenge traditions. Creative thinkers with a purpose are looking to innovate and invent. They are people who seek problems.

Creative people allow their work to create the plan, rather than force a plan upon their work. The passion that they have for their work drives them to become masters. They become almost obsessed with their experience to the point they call it a “rage to master.”  Creatives engage their work with passion.

Creative people love new experiences. They engage, explore, and learn from the unfamiliar, both physically and mentally. This drives neuroplasticity and satisfies their creative nature. By nature, creative people are sensitive and perceptive. 

Can anyone become creative? Most people think that you either are creative or not – you were either born with it or not… but that’s not true.
The answer to the question is yes. You can start practicing creativity today.

How can you become more creative? 

Remember the kid in class who got caught daydreaming while the teacher was lecturing? Whether that kid was you or not, they were on to something good! Daydreaming is an excellent way to get your creative juices flowing. But for many of us, we're taught that daydreaming is a bad thing. So, permit yourself to daydream. Think positive about it, and about yourself engaging in it. But also, think positive about yourself. You are a lot more creative than you give yourself credit for. You may have labeled yourself as “not creative at all,” and if you do, that belief is the only thing holding you back. 

Have you ever had a difficult problem to solve, but came up with the solution while on break? That’s the power of daydreaming and intuitive thinking. Daydreaming and intuitive thinking help creative people connect with their inner selves. When the conscious mind isn’t working on solving a problem, intuition is free to operate. 

So, take a walk in the park and let your mind wander. Also, meditate and let your thoughts flow but don’t hold on to them. Furthermore, embrace solitude to rest your focus.

Take this into your daily life, believe you can do anything – but start with whatever task is at hand right now. Do not fear failure. Embrace failure because it’s part of the process of creation. Use misfortune and failure as opportunities for growth.

Originality is your key to a fulfilling career, but it takes creativity to be original. This is why creativity is so important. Also, quantity leads to quality when it comes to generating great ideas. Let the ideas flow out of you, write them down, and then choose the good ones. 

Another important topic relative to creativity is procrastination. 
It is often labeled as a negative attribute. Procrastination can be a tool in your problem solving strategies. Leaving things to the last minute makes us more creative because it forces us to improvise. When you improvise, you engage your lateral thinking skills. This helps you see solutions in new places. There are times when it is never a good idea to procrastinate – you must be the one to decide when it is and when it isn’t.

At times, Creative people can be precieved as radical and eccentric. But you must drop that bias and embrace the idea of being creative yourself. Make your own radical ideas familiar by getting them out there into the world more often. Embrace your creative side. 

New experiences result in inspiration. Learn, explore and engage with the unfamiliar is a key indicator of creative success. Exploring the unknown both mentally and physically drives psychological plasticity and gives dopamine. You will love it.

Remove “yes people” who agree with you on everything. The best collaborators are the ones that push back on your ideas. This helps you grow.
Develop your ideas and share your best ones with others. Surround yourself with disruptive thinkers. Make them feel comfortable about sharing their opinions. Psychological saftey is essential to fostering a collaborative environment. 

Misfortune and problems are now your opportunities.

imaginative thinking skills; a venturesome personality; intrinsic motivation; 
and a creative environment that sparks, supports, and refines creative ideas.
