# Grit

Now that you have decided to improve your life, the key to achieving it is grit. Grit is about having perseverance and tenacity. It is keeping your word to yourself and others. It helps you stick to your values under pressure and follow through with your goals. 

Grit is essential for creating a satisfying, fulfilled life.  You can learn anything but that doesn't mean that it is easy. Learning is about discovering your knowledge boundary. When you hit it, grit helps you push through that boundary. That is the key to mastery.

When you decide to do something, commit to it through thick and thin. Do not give up. When your learning and frustrated, that is good. You are at your knowledge boundary. Seek out challenges above your skill level to improve your grit. Set yourself a task, define its length and deadline. Plan what you must do to stay on track. Repeat and build it into a habit as a cornerstone of your identity. 

You should indeed do something that you love, but you will always hit rough patches. Hard work can lead to procrastination and doubt and thatâ€™s where grit comes in.
