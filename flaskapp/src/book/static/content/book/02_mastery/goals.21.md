# Goals

Time mastery and goal mastery are very similar, but we will focus only on goal setting in this short chapter.
Goal mastery and management are best accomplished by categorizing goals into levels. Current projects and tasks generate level 1 tasks. 
Accountabilities, personal growth, health, finances, socialization, family, and planning generate level 2 tasks. 
Yearly goals generate level 3 tasks. A long-term vision such as where you want to be in 3 to 5 years, and career aspirations generate level 4 tasks. 
Life’s purpose or why do you exist generates level 5 tasks.

### How to Create Goals

To create a goal, establish a vision of the end goal before you begin. Then, write it down and make sure that 
it is specific. For example, the goal of “Write my book” is too general. But “Write 500 words in my book every 
day” is specific. 
Next, set a date by which you think you can complete your goal. Be realistic. If it is large, break it down into 
milestones with sub-deadlines. 
Next, write down a list of everything you could do to achieve your goal. Include obstacles and the a
list of skills and knowledge you will need to achieve it. In our example of writing your book, let’s say that 
your obstacle was that you don’t have peace, quiet, and the time you need to write your book. The solution 
may be to write down a sub-goal of getting up half an hour early every morning so you can write your 500 words in 
your book every day. 
And if you needed more knowledge to get your book published, in this example, then another goal would be to study 
how to self-publish your book. 
Rank your most beneficial tasks and then add them to your calendar. The most important goals should be 
completed first, according to the ABCDE Method. 
Start working on your tasks right away. Do something every day that helps you achieve your goals. At the very 
least, sit down and look at your tasks. This is the non-zero-day concept.

### Get into the Flow

Having a clear vision of your goals feels good. Use the GTD and ABCDE methods to organize and rank your goals, and then execute on them. When discipline yourself enough to follow the systems described, you will activate flow.  It is the feeling of being in the zone.
Once you build this into a habit, you will progress every day towards your dreams and goals. This is momentum.

Flow state can activate by challenging yourself at your knowledge boundary. Language and memory games can trigger flow state.
To keep yourself motivated tie your challenges to personal rewards. Reward yourself with something healthy that you enjoy. Life is about living.
Remember that the tasks that you choose to create shouldn’t be too difficult or too easy. It's a balance finding that knowledge boundary.
If it is too difficult ask for help. If it is too easy, delegate it.
You need to be able to do your tasks with sustained effort. 
Turn your progress into a habit and you will have mastered goal setting.
