 # The present

To understand our present situation, we look at two things. The exponetial decrease in cost per computation and
the proliferation of the internet.

These two things has put massive technological deflationary pressure on goods and services. If you are my age,
you remember the immense transformation that the internet had on the music and adverting industries.

This deflationary pressure comes from the automation of labor. In 2011, robot sales grew 43%. We are 
witnessing cascading effects in the economy as humans are replaced and unemployment rises. 
The economy demands a different set of skills
that were needed in the past. This has caused a rise in populism and a shift in a way people consume and produce.

This is the age of the prosumer. Historically, the costs of producing and distributing something were too high
for ordinary people. The production was centralized to a hand full of large conglomerates and companies. 
The internet has eliminated that barrier. Today, more than a third of the world's population distributes their own photots, art, films, music
and writing across the internet. Prosumers trade their goods and services globally or give them away for free.
