# Autonomy

To have autonomy is to have the ability to make your own decisions. It allows you to define your life by your actions, values, feelings, and desires. 

In short, autonomy is to self-determine, to carve your own path through life's thicket.

Being objective about oneself is an important characteristic of the autonomous person. In short, autonomy is an inside job—it is a function of the mind and a person’s belief.

To first achieve autonomy, we must free ourselves from the lies we tell ourselves. Lies like ‘I can’t read a book, I get too distracted,’ or ‘I can’t go on a run because I’m tired.’ These are excuses, and when you say these words of powerlessness you give up your autonomy. 

Autonomy is about responsibility. It’s also about putting blame behind you. I understand that we all have different environments and circumstances in life. But blame—rather than action—won’t get us anywhere. To be autonomous we must take control.

Here’s something you can do to become more autonomous: reflect upon your strengths and weaknesses. Write ten weaknesses you have, then write down ten strengths.

Once you do this, you can start to identify your motivations, cognitive biases, and bad habits. Can you refine your strengths further? Can you improve on your weaknesses? 

If you understand your weaknesses better, you’ll prevent external sources from manipulating you. Think of it like this: If you take control of your health by eating well, exercising, and sleeping properly, you are far less likely going to have to rely on getting medical care and medication to ailments. You’ll be taking control of yourself in the present, lowering your chances of having to rely on medicine later in life. 

If you take the lot of humanity's problems such as climate change, the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, or dying monetary systems, they all have similar top-down issues—a group of people psychologically manipulating the majority.

That manipulation starts with the abstract constructs we discussed earlier. Narratives get built and served us that aren't in our best interest, often the function of propaganda. Developing our critical thinking skills helps defend against propaganda. The first step is understanding the difference between fixed and growth-oriented mindsets. 

Fixed mindsets mean we’re not using our autonomy to shape and change our thoughts and behaviors despite being confronted with evidence—these keep up in the same place on life’s mountain climb. Growth-oriented mindsets prioritise that mountain climb and keep us ascending. Being committed to a growth mindset can help us better versions of ourselves. 

If we keep getting better, we’ll be able to master autonomy, and be the string-pullers in our own lives. Once we master ourselves, we can master our environment.
