Autonomy is to have the ability to make your own decisions. It is to define your life by your actions, values, feelings, and desires. 

In short, autonomy is to self-determine, to carve your own path through life’s thicket.

Being objective about oneself is an important characteristic of the autonomous person. Getting autonomy is much more of an inside job that and outside one.

To first achieve autonomy, we must free ourselves from the lies we tell ourselves. Lies like “I can’t read a book, I get too distracted,” or “I can’t go on a run because I’m tired.” These are excuses, and when you say these words of powerlessness you give up your autonomy. 

Autonomy is about responsibility. It’s also about putting blame behind you—it’s no one else’s fault you are where you are. 

Here’s something you can do to become more autonomous: reflect upon your strengths and weaknesses. Write them down.

Once you do this, you can start to identify your motivations, cognitive biases, and bad habits. 

This will prevent external sources from manipulating you. Think of it: If you take control of your health by eating well, exercising, and sleeping properly, you are far less likely going to have to rely on getting medical care and medication. 

If you take the lot of humanity's problems such as climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, or dying monetary systems, they all boil down to a similar point—a small group of people psychologically manipulating the majority. (WHAT DO YOU MEAN HERE? PLEASE ELABORATE)

The first step is understanding the difference between fixed and growth-oriented mindsets. Once we understand these, we can become better versions of ourselves. In other words, we need to become our best internally before we sort out what’s external to us. 

Once we master ourselves, we can master our environment.
