Autonomy is to have the ability to make your own decisions. It is to define your life by your actions, values, feelings, and desires. 

In short, autonomy is to self-determine, to carve your own path through life's thicket.

Being objective about oneself is an important characteristic of the autonomous person. Getting autonomy is much more of an inside job that and outside one.

To first achieve autonomy, we must free ourselves from the lies we tell ourselves. Lies like ‘I can’t read a book, I get too distracted,’ or ‘I can’t go on a run because I’m tired.’ These are excuses, and when you say these words of powerlessness you give up your autonomy. 

Autonomy is about responsibility. It’s also about putting blame behind you. I understand that we all have different environments and circumstances in life. But blame—rather than action—won’t get us anywhere. To be autonomous we must take control.

Here’s something you can do to become more autonomous: reflect upon your strengths and weaknesses. Write ten weaknesses you have, then write down ten strengths.

Once you do this, you can start to identify your motivations, cognitive biases, and bad habits. Can you refine your strengths further? Can you improve on your weaknesses? What can you do?

If you understand your weaknesses better, you’ll prevent external sources from manipulating you. Think of it like this: If you take control of your health by eating well, exercising, and sleeping properly, you are far less likely going to have to rely on getting medical care and medication to ailments. You’re taking control of yourself right now and ensuring your chances of having to rely on medicine are lower. 

If you take the lot of humanity's problems such as climate change, the effecacy of Covid-19 vaccines, 
or dying monetary systems, they all boil down to a similar point—a small group of 
people psychologically manipulating the majority.

That manipulation starts with the abstract constructs we talked about earlier. 
Naritives get built and served us that aren't in our best interest. Developing our critical thinking skills helps defend against
propaganda.
The first step is understanding the difference between fixed and growth-oriented mindsets. 
Once we understand these, we can become better versions of ourselves. 
If we keep getting better, we will be able to master ourselves.

Once we master ourselves, we can master our environment.
