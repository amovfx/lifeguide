# Willpower

Willpower is the ability to do what we dislike in the present for long-term benefit and gain. You usually hear someone has good willpower when they quit a cigarette or other addiction. The feelings of withdrawals are especially strong in the beginning, but the long term benefit is greater health, fitness, breathing capacity, and ability to deal with stressors without the substance.

“I will” is a powerful statement, hence the word, “willpower.” “I will” is a statement of strong intention. However, but without grit, it loses strength. In short, grit + willpower = results. 

“I won’t” is also a powerful statement of intent. But it’s not a positive one if you use it in the wrong context, like ‘I won’t be able to do that’. (But you can use it positively, like, “I won’t give up training for the marathon).

“I will” and “I won’t” use up the same limited resource of energy. Doing things you don’t like and not doing things you do like will drain the same thing. 

We can use mindful meditation to increase awareness of ourselves. It helps us to have the willpower to avoid distractions, of which our modern world is full of. It also helps us pause, which allows our minds to focus, which lets us plan. Planning strengthens willpower.

To keep the reserve of mental determination we need for willpower, eat low glycaemic foods, such as nuts, cereals, fruits, vegetables, and wholegrains. Practice "I won't" by keeping a “bad” foods nearby so you can refuse them. 

To embrace willpower, we don’t indulge in the present temptations that surround us. Also, we’ll embrace humility (which we’ll cover next). Just a warning: thinking of ourselves as virtuous lowers self-awareness which jeopardizes our self-control. 

Another thing to keep our willpower tank full is learn how to best manage stress. Stress can trigger downward spirals. Feeling bad can trigger cravings and high expectations. 

Distancing ourselves from the temptation makes the temptation weaker. Pushing aside temptations can make the craving stronger. Of course, it’s better not to have the temptation in the first place. But we’re all human, and it’s always possible for us to fall prey to a vice.

Now, it’s best to practice using an “I will” rather than an “I won’t”, because will connotes a positive. For example, say “I will eat healthy” 
instead of “I won’t eat that chocolate cake,” it becomes easier to rearrange the environment. Plus, I will eat healthy is an encompassing phenomenon, the chocolate cake is one example. What will you do when you’re faced with potato chips? You’ll come up with a new “I won’t” statement (or you can stay within the “I will” camp—“I will eat healthy,” and ignore the cake and the potato chips!).

Willpower is contagious. Practicing it with others increases the likelihood of success from 24% to 66%. 

We need to surround ourselves with people that we want to emulate as this will help strengthen our willpower. We must imagine our future selves looking back on our present selves. When we take our futures into consideration, our willpower in the present strengthens. Aim to please the you in one year from now, rather than the you sitting there desiring to play video games all day every day.
