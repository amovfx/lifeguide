# Willpower

Willpower is the ability to do what we dislike in the present for the long-term benefit and gain. 
“I will” is a powerful statement, hence the word, “willpower.” “I will” is a statement of strong intention but without grit, it loses strength. 

“I won’t” against bad habits is also a powerful statement of intent.  

“I will” and “I won’t” drain the same limited resource. Doing things you don’t like and not doing things you do like takes energy from the same source. 
It is a biological instinct that protects us from harm in the long run. It’s a response like “fight or flight.” It is “pause and plan.”

We can use mindful meditation to increase awareness of ourselves. It helps avoid distractions and it helps us to keep our willpower. 
To keep the reserve of mental determination we need for willpower,  Eat low glycemic foods, such as nuts, cereals, 
fruits, vegetables, and grains. Practice "I won't" by keeping of “bad” foods nearby so you can refuse it – make sure to not indulge!

To embrace willpower, we don’t indulge in the present temptations that surround us. Also, we embrace the feeling of humility which we will cover next. 
Thinking that we are virtuous lowers self-awareness which jeopardizes our self-control. 

Another thing to keep our willpower tank full is to manage stress. Stress can trigger downward spirals. Feeling bad can 
trigger cravings and high expectations. 
Distancing ourselves from the temptation makes the temptation weaker. Pushing aside temptations makes the craving stronger. 
It’s better to not have the temptation in the first place. 
In other words, use the “I will” component to drown out the “I won’t.” For example, say “I will eat healthy” 
instead of “I won’t eat that chocolate cake!” We will have much more success rearranging your environment. 
Remove triggers from our lives for things we don't want to do.

Willpower is contagious. Practicing it with others increases the likelihood of success from 24% to 66%. 
We need to surround ourselves with people that we want to emulate. Imagine our future selves looking back on our present self. 
It will be easier to exercise willpower.
Remember that willpower is weak and we have limited reserves.
