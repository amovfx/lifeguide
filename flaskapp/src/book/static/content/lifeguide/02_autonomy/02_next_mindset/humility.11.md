# Humility

Humility comes from understanding our place in the larger order of things. It entails not taking our desires, successes, or failings too seriously, raising our readiness to engage in prosocial behavior. Humility is having the modesty to understand we can do better, to not overstate our achievements.

Someone with humility is humble. And a humble person has a more accurate perception of themselves. Humble people also can acknowledge their mistakes and limitations. They have a willingness to see themselves truthfully and will seek to overcome the weaknesses in their personalities and make amends for their mistakes. 

The attributes present in a humble person make them excellent co-operators and leaders.

Humility makes us more open to appreciate life, self-aware, and adaptable to change. It helps increase our empathy, and allows us to be better aware of our environment and others’ problems, feelings, and emotions.

Everyone gets along better with humble people, and cooperation leads to success. For example, if you admit your weakness during a sales pitch, you’ll help reduce your customer’s risk. They know what they are getting with honesty. People trust others more who can look at themselves objectively. If you make a song and dance and oversell yourself, people will smell the inauthenticity of your words and character. You want people to see you as authentic as they’ll more likely collaborate with you.

Humility is essential for growth. It allows us to see when people are more capable or have more knowledge in fields we do not. Without humility, we can become know-it-alls. The most important thing for us to know is that we don’t know very much!

Once you identify people who have skills in areas that you may not, reach out and ask for help. Often, they will help us with our problems, because people love talking about what they are good at—and most people are willing to find solutions.

Those who are not humble should learn how to be, and those who are humble must use their skills to build teams to be as strong as possible. 

In short, to be humble is to be honest with yourself. Learn how to be humbler through a stronger examination of your strengths and weaknesses and think of people you could surround yourself with that you can benefit with your strengths and who can use their strengths to benefit your weaknesses. This will allow you to be more autonomous, and it’ll improve your life tenfold. 

#Compound Advantage

Humility helps us recognize our advantages. How we were raised has a radical impact how successful we become. 

One of the most important factors determining success is when we are born. The next is where we are born, then to whom we are born. Obviously,
if we come of age during a computing revolution, at the center of it, our chances of success rise dramatically.

Practical intelligence is procedural knowledge. Knowing how to interpret and work social situations to get what we want. This knowledge is not innate and is taught by our parents and guardians.

Where we come from geographically and culturally can have a particularly large effect on what we achieve. Cultural legacy provides a large influence in this. If we can recognize the uneven playing field, we can start to level it.

Extraordinary success is often the result of an unlikely series of opportunities. Lucky breaks and occurrences combine to create conditions that allow for great achievement. In 2011, I mis-spelled a search on Reddit and was introduced to Bitcoin by the error's recommendation in 2011. I haven’t looked back from crypto since.

Many successful people claim to be “self-made.” But that is a myth. No one becomes successful without help along the way. We built our society together. Nearly all successful people didn’t build the car they drive. Or the internet they use. Or the phones they speak on. Or source the food they eat. Plenty of them don’t even cook the food!

Despite our combined efforts throughout time, the “self-made” myth persists. Although some people build themselves up from a lower starting point than others, every one has help in one way or another.
