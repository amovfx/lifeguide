# Grit

Now that we have decided to improve our lives, the key to achieving improving ourselves is grit. Some may argue it’s motivation or inspiration, but grit allows us to keep improving even when we feel demotivated or uninspired. Grit is about having perseverance and tenacity. To have grit means we keep our word to ourselves and others, and to work out hardest to achieve what we’ve promised. It helps us stick to our values under pressure and follow through with our goals. 

Grit is essential for creating a satisfying, fulfilled life. We can learn anything we want—but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. 

Learning is about discovering our knowledge boundary. When we realize where our boundaries are, grit helps us push through them. When we push through our boundaries, we start to gain mastery.

When you decide you want to do or achieve something, commit to it through thick and thin. Do not give up. When we are learning and frustrated, 
that is good—it means we’re at the knowledge boundary. It means that at some point, we’ll break through the boundary and keep learning more and more. When we seek out challenges above our skill level, must implement more grit to meet these challenges.
 
When we set ourselves a task, we need to define its length and deadline. Then, we must plan what we must do to stay on track. We’ll repeat this so it becomes a habit and a cornerstone of our identity. 

It’s important to do things we love doing, but we will always hit rough patches. Hard work can lead to procrastination and doubt, but that’s where grit comes in. Improve your grit, improve your life, and get ever-closer to the autonomy you need to get ahead in life.
