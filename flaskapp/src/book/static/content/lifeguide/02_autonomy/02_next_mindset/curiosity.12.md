# Curiosity and Creativity

Dr E. Paul Torrance described creativity as "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly 
modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results."

Sternberg has proposed that creativity has five components: expertise, 
imaginative thinking skills; a venturesome personality; intrinsic motivation; and a creative environment that sparks, supports, and refines creative ideas.

In the book Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi defines creative people as: [ANDREW: IS THE FOLLOWING A QUOTE? IF SO, NEEDS QUOTATION MARKS] People who seem stimulating, interesting, and have a variety of unusual thoughts. People who perceive the world with a fresh perspective, have insightful ideas, and make important personal discoveries. These individuals make creative discoveries that are generally known only to them.

Inventors and artists such as Thomas Edison and Pablo Picasso would fall into Csikszentmihalyi’s creative person category, but they made great creative achievements that become known to the entire world. Creatives embrace contradictions. They relish the creative thought it takes to ponder conflict in the world. They prefer to challenge tradition, traditional thought, and the idea that something must be done a certain way because that’s the way it’s always been done. Creative thinkers with a purpose are constantly looking for new, innovative ways to solve old problems. They are process improvement seekers and conquerors. 

Creative people allow their work to create the plan, rather than force a plan upon their work. The passion that they have for their work drives them to become masters. They often become almost obsessed with their 
creative experience to the point where they call it a “rage to master.”  
Creatives engage their work with passion and are constantly looking to solve problems, including ones in their personal creative pursuits. 

Creative people love new experiences. They engage, explore, and learn from the unfamiliar, both physically and mentally. This drives neuroplasticity and satisfies their creative nature. However, creatives are always on the search for answers and therefore constantly create new questions. In one sense, they have insatiable curiosity. However, by nature, creative people are sensitive and perceptive. 

Can anyone become creative? Most people think that we either are creative or not, but that’s not true.

Remember when we discussed fixed-mindsets before and that we can opt for a growth-oriented mindset? We can start being creative today. Let’s explore this further.

How can we become more creative? 

Remember the kid in class who got caught daydreaming while the teacher was speaking, and he got in trouble?
Well, the teacher just stifled his creativity. Sure, we all want to be listened to when we talk. But when the mind wonders, it tends to be looking for creative solutions. Mind wandering is essential to peak functioning.

Daydreaming is an excellent way to get our creative juices flowing. But for many of us, we're taught that daydreaming is a bad thing. So, let's permit ourselves to daydream. Let’s start daydreaming.

In fact, our world overly prioritizes focus on individual problems. Sometimes, this is beneficial. Need to turn off a smoke alarm? You don’t need to daydream and think of countless scenarios—you just need to turn off the smoke alarm. However, with lots of other problems, daydreaming is perfect. We tend to do more daydreaming when we’re walking, running, driving, or lying in bed (before sleeping!).

Have you ever had a difficult problem to solve, but came up with the solution while on break? At work, when you step away from your desk, that’s sometimes the best time to find a solution. And that’s the power of daydreaming and intuitive thinking. Daydreaming and intuitive thinking help creative people connect with their inner selves. 

When the conscious mind isn’t working on solving a problem, intuition is free to operate. 

So, take a walk in the park and let your mind wander. Opt for solitude. When you’re in the park, you can even meditate and let your thoughts flow. 

Do not fear failure. Embrace failure because it’s part of the process of creation. Use misfortune and failure as opportunities for growth. Creative problem solving has a trial-and-error process within it. Think about when you type out a text message or an email and you decide it doesn’t quite say exactly what you want it to say, so you edit it until it does. That editing is engaging your creative problem solving abilities.

Quantity leads to quality when it comes to generating great ideas. Let the ideas flow, write them down, and then choose the good ones to polish up. 

Another important topic relative to creativity is procrastination. 
Procrastination is often labelled as a negative attribute. However, it can be a tool in your problem-solving strategies. Sometimes, you can feel too overburdened by a task and procrastinating gives your mind to put the task to your subconscious. You’re not always ignoring it, sometimes your brain is working out the issue behind the scenes.

Leaving things to the last minute makes us more creative because it forces us to improvise. When you improvise, you engage your lateral thinking skills. This helps you see solutions in new places. However, procrastination can still be nothing but time wasting because you’re ignoring your responsibilities. It’s up to you to know yourself well enough to know if it’s productive or unproductive procrastination.

Sometimes creative people are perceived as radical and eccentric. But we must drop that bias and embrace the idea that creativity is useful, and you can be creative yourself. The only way we can make our own radical ideas familiar is by getting them out there into the world more often.

New experiences result in inspiration. Learn, explore, and engage with the unfamiliar and you hit a key indicator of creative success. Exploring the unknown both mentally and physically drives psychological plasticity and provides the brain with the reward of dopamine, one of the feel-good neurotransmitters.

Remove “yes people” who agree with you on everything. The best collaborators are the ones that push back on our ideas. This helps us grow and challenges us to come up with different solutions. Of course, you don’t need to listen to everything a critic says, but you should certainly take it into consideration.

It’s essential we develop our ideas and share our best ones with others and surround ourselves with disruptive thinkers. Other creative problem solvers will also have great ideas and the more we put our minds with other creative thinkers, the better the solution is likely to become.

Build a psychologically safe environment where collaboration can foster and others feel comfortable about sharing ideas and opinions.


Misfortune and problems are now our opportunities. Be curious. Be creative.
