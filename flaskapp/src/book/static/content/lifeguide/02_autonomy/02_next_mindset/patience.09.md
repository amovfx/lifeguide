# Patience

Patience is the ability to control our emotional state. Impatient people are more depressed and suffer more from stress. Patient people tend to have better outcomes, because they know how to wait. When you are negotiating with someone, you must be patient after you tell them your bit. You must be okay in silence, let the cogs turn in their heads. Those who rush will talk themselves out of a better deal.

Patience is an immense skill in achieving your desired outcome. Some of us have a shorter fuse than others, but anyone can develop more patience if they feel that they need it. When we have patience, we can focus more on long-term goals. 

According to research psychologist Sarah Schnitker, patience comes in three main varieties: 

 * Daily hassles patience
 * Life hardship patience
 * Interpersonal patience

A daily hassle event would be something like getting stuck in morning traffic. It can make us feel impatient, and perhaps even nervous we’re not going to get somewhere on time. However, impatience doesn’t get us to our destination any quicker. In fact, it could make us drive more recklessly and dangerously. It’s better to use the time productively—put on an audiobook or a podcast.

A life hardship event would be something like losing our jobs or getting a cancer diagnosis. These are more challenging because they permeate through every part of our day-to-day living and may lurk in the background even if we’re focused on a task.

An interpersonal hardship event is between two or more people. A parent teaching their son or daughter how to drive is an interpersonal event.
Both sides need patience, the parent to be a good teacher, and the son/daughter to be a good student. 

How can we be more patient? 

When we feel impatient and we feel like lashing out, stop and acknowledge it. It might feel frustrating, but relabel it. Call it opportunity. Call it being at the edge of a knowledge boundary. 

The more you practice patience, the better at it you will become. One way to cultivate patience is to breathe slowly and deeply. Before you respond to something that’s making you feel impatient, take one, long breath through your nose. Hold it for a few seconds. Then say your piece. 

If you are at your limit, remove yourself from the conversation or situation. Make it clear that whatever situation needs addressing you will do so when calm. This will be far more effective than addressing the issue when you feel at the end of your patience, when you’re far more likely to say things in that state you want to take back later.

Additionally, there are exercises for patience like meditation and yoga. Go on YouTube and find ones that suit you. A daily practice will help your patience to no end.

Being patient with others doesn’t mean that we should be passive and never stand up for ourselves. 

There are times when it is appropriate to speak up and show your displeasure. 

Get yourself into as calm of a place as you can when you do speak up. But you can still be assertive, just don’t tilt into aggression. You don’t want to make other people feel defensive, otherwise they’re unlikely to be open to your point of view.

Be patient and know that the rewards of will come your way.
