#Mindset

Now that we have learned how to label our emotions and behaviour, we must now believe that we can change. Remember ‘neuroplasticity?’—you and your brain can literally change. You’re not fixed.
 
Updating your mindset is the most important and most difficult step in the Life Guide. Some people are more open than others, and can change their mind with relative ease. For most of us, it’s more difficult than that. 

A fixed mindset believes that abilities are set at birth. This is the furthest thing possible from the truth. We’re not blank slates, waiting to be written on. We have our hardware (brain) which does determine some of our behaviour, but we have the software of our environment, who we interact with, what we need, etc., which can change our brains.

Before we leave behind out mindsets that keep us at the base of the mountain and instead opt for a "growth-oriented mindset" that’ll help us climb, let’s see where a fixed mindset comes from.

The education system reinforces a fixed mindset. The grading system encourages us to seek approval over growth. We receive grades regardless of understanding, we just need to be able to regurgitate rather than understand.

The education system also doesn't take into account the "natural talent barrier". Natural talent can only take you so far before you hit a ceiling. There’s hard work to put in too if you want to be successful.

Some people hit this celling earlier than others. To get to the next level, requires focus and diligent practice. So why do people of the same
ages move up at the same rate, in the same subjects?

A growth-oriented mindset believes that with perseverance, we can learn anything. 

The discovery of neuroplasticity proves this. Neuroplasticity shows us that we can shape ourselves into whom we want to be and what we want to do. 

It starts with believing that we can change for the better. With this simple decision you are ready to leave your ill-imposed false limits behind you.

The attributes of a fixed mindset are:

 * Avoiding difficulties.
 * Telling ourselves we are good at something's but not others.
 * View failure as a disaster.
 * Seeking approval over development.

Now that we can recognize fixed-mindset attributes, we can replace them with the following:

 * Seek out difficulties.
 * We achieve what we focus on.
 * Failure is a discovery of a knowledge boundary and should be celebrated.
 * Seek learning and development over approval.

Anyone can adopt a growth mindset. Anyone that has told us otherwise lied to us. What we achieve and who we become is our choice.

Want to speed up this change? When meeting someone new, if the opportunity arises, state that you have a growth-oriented mindset. Act curious. Read new books. Watch new things. Go to new places. Tell yourself that you have this mindset in the mirror.

The more you repeat this, the more your brain will rewire to fit this expectation. The more you believe in your growth-oriented mindset, the more you’ll engage in growth-oriented behaviours, and vice-versa.

The next step is developing our vision, grit, curiosity, humility and patience.
