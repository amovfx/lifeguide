# Vision


After we have made the decision that we can do anything, we must start visualizing the life we want to live.

The human brain isn't wired to think past one or two years from the evolution of our development. But like anything, 
this is something that can learned.

Another good question to ask ourselves is, where do we want to be in 15-20 years? Where do we have to be in 10? 
Where do we have to be in 5? Where do we have to be in 1? Where do we have to be next month? Where do we have to be 
tomorrow? This vision should be in line with your intrinsic motivators and identity. 

First, we build the long view timeline and start breaking it down into manageable goals. This is also called, "starting 
with the end in mind". These don't have to be set in stone, it will change as we grow as human beings.

To start building our vision skills, we start small. Every evening, write down what tasks should be completed the next day
Visualize doing it before going to sleep. The next day, make sure to do it and cross it off. This builds self-trust. Start with an easy 
manageable task, like making your bed first thing. This builds a good habit, which is discussed in the next chapter. 
When noticing tasks being missed, walk some tasks back to reduce the workload.
