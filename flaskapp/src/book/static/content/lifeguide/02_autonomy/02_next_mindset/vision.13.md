# Vision


After we have made the decision that we can do anything, we must start visualizing the life we want to live.

The human brain isn't wired to think beyond one or two years since the evolution of our development. But like anything, this is something that can learned. Five years from now may not feel emotionally important to us, but we understand intellectually that we’re going to exist in five years.

But we can stretch it further than that. Another good question to ask ourselves is, where do we want to be in 15-20 years? Where do we have to be in 10? Where do we have to be in 5? Where do we have to be in 1? Where do we have to be next month? Where do we have to be tomorrow? This vision should be in line with your intrinsic motivators and identity. 

First, we build the long view timeline and start breaking it down into manageable goals. This is also called, "starting with the end in mind". These don't have to be set in stone, it will change as we climb the mountain and grow as human beings.

To start building our vision skills, start small. Every evening, write down what tasks should be completed the next day. Visualize doing it before going to sleep. The next day, make sure to do it and cross it off in your mind. This builds self-trust. 

Start with an easy and manageable task, like making your bed when you first wake up. Now you’re starting the day off with a good, disciplined habit that’ll make your life that much better. Habits will be discussed in the next chapter. 

When noticing tasks being missed, walk some tasks back to reduce the workload. Cultivate that vision!
