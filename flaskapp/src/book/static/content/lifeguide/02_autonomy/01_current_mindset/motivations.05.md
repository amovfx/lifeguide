# Motivation

There are two different types of motivation: 1) Intrinsic and 2) extrinsic.

Intrinsic motivation is doing an activity for its inherit satisfaction. 
It is when we do something because it’s fun and/or challenging to please ourselves creativity. A hobby.

Extrinsic motivation is reward-driven behavior. It is when we do something for praise, money, power, sex, social status, or knowledge.

It is important to realize the link between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. 

**Extrinsic rewards can destroy intrinsic motivation.** 

This finding came from a study where children that liked to draw were separated into two groups. 

The researchers paid one group and not the other to draw for one hour. After the hour was complete, the researchers told both groups to stop. The paid group put all their pencils down. The unpaid group continued to draw.

Our intrinsic motivators are stronger than our extrinsic motivators. But our extrinsic motivators can muddy our intrinsic ones. Let's be aware of our minds, making sure we don't lose track of what we love to do because a reward incentive is in place. Let’s not let our intrinsic motivation be smothered by extrinsic motivation. 

We must make sure we are prioritizing our intrinsic motivators before our extrinsic ones.
