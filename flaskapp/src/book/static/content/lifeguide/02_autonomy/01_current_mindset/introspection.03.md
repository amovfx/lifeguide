# Introspection

To begin this journey, we must be able to acknowledge our shortcomings.

Psychometrics are a great way begin our journey into ourselves. Let me start by saying that psychometric testing is like the astrology of psychology—a pseudoscience rooted in a for-profit motive. 

However, psychometrics can provide insight into how we label our behaviour. (HOW? – PLEASE ANSWER AS THIS FEELS OPINION-DRIVEN)
 
What really motivates us? 

Motivations are essential to understand. If we don't understand what motivates us, then others can, at best, gain in negotiations and, at worst, completely manipulate and control our actions.

You must have control of your emotions and be able to recognize when someone is appealing to your rational or irrational desires. If, for example, a news station is trying to make you fearful, it’s appealing to your irrational and emotional responses. Fear plays on a primal system and is therefore easier to manipulate. There’s a reason your actions are more likely to be determined through emotive anecdotes rather than statistics, even though statistics can show how good or bad something really is, it’s too abstract. 

What grips you more: 1 in 10 people have a fall at home in the first year after their 80th birthday, or my poor grandma Margaret tripped down the stairs and hit her head?

But let’s move tracks a bit and discuss cognitive biases. 

Cognitive biases teach us that, more often than not, we’re our own worst enemy. 

We need to understand our weaknesses, if not we will be forever bound by them.

Once we recognize our pitfalls, we can set about correcting them and effectively manage ourselves and make decisions based on logic and reason.

Nothing in us is fixed. We’re fluid in our individual personalities, and we change over time. Don’t believe me? Think of how you acted 5 or 10 years ago. How different do you feel? 

Also, there’s a thing in neuroscience called “neuroplasticity,” and it shows the shape of your brain is adapting, modifying, and changing all the time.

This guide will help guide you to be more adept at introspection.
