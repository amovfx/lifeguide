# Introspection


To begin our journey and become more introspective, we must be able to acknowledge our shortcomings. It may seem counterproductive that we were discussing objectivity before and now we’ve got to look inwards and be more subjective. Remember that without an understanding of your own subjectivities, objectivity is impossible.

Psychometrics are a great way begin our journey into ourselves. Let me start by saying that psychometric testing isn’t really the be all and end all our personality. Although it’s not 100% accurate, it can still help us understand our behaviours better. I suggest you take one, and see which of the results resonate with you.


What really motivates us? 

It’s essential that we understand our motivations. If we fail to understand what motivates us, then others can, at best, gain in negotiations and, at worst, completely manipulate and control our actions.

You must have control of your emotions and be able to recognize when someone is appealing to your rational or irrational desires to work out if they’re trying to manipulate you. If, for example, a news station is trying to make you fearful, it’s appealing to your irrational and emotional responses. Fear plays on a primal system and is therefore easier to manipulate. There’s a reason your actions are more likely to be determined through emotive anecdotes rather than statistics, even though statistics paint a wider picture of a scenario, they can be too abstract. 

What grips you more: 1 in 10 people have a fall at home in the first year after their 80th birthday, or my poor grandma Margaret tripped down the stairs and smacked her head? That’s right, the latter. The anecdote (filled with language designed to provoke a response: “poor,” “smacked”) is more gripping. Pay attention to this, especially when you see news reports. Think of the difference between “a man ended another man’s life” and “a man sickeningly murders another man in cold blood.” The news will use headlines like the latter to provide a response in you.

Right. Let’s move tracks a bit and discuss cognitive biases. 

Cognitive biases teach us that, more often than not, we’re our own worst enemy. We’re all prey to these biases, and our perceptions don’t tell us the whole story. If you don’t believe me, just go look at an optical illusion—your brain constructs things that aren’t objectively there. Why? It’s trying to make sense of it. 

Therefore, if we fail to understand our cognitive biases—and the weaknesses they give rise to—we’ll be forever bound by them.

However, once we recognize our weaknesses, we can set about correcting them and effectively manage ourselves to make our decisions based on logic and reason. 

Nothing in us is fixed. We’re fluid in our individual personalities, and we change over time. Don’t believe me? Think of how you acted 5 or 10 years ago. Do you feel like the exact same person? Unlikely. 

Also, there’s a thing that neuroscientists call ‘neuroplasticity,’ which means the shape of your brain is adapting, modifying, and changing all the time. You’re more cognitively flexible than you think!

Let’s get introspective.
