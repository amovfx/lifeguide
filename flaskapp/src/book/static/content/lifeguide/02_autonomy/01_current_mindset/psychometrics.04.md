#Psychometric testing

Psychometric testing is a fancy way of saying “personality test.” I think psychometric testing is mainly pseudoscientific. However, psychometrics do get something right: they showcase a wide variety of personality traits and behaviours. When we do these tests, we can read these traits and behaviours and see which ones resonate with us. 

In turn, we can recognize when specific emotions within us cause specific reactions. When we realize these emotions, we can better control them, and get better control over our reactions. 

Take all these tests with a grain of salt, but pick and choose what resonates with you. The more you take of these tests, the more you may learn about yourself. Rather than seeing the personality categories as fitting you exactly, use your own discretion. If something doesn’t sound like you at all, and you’ve deeply considered the possibility, then discard it.

There are a variety of tests that you can do to learn more about yourself. These following tests measure personality attributes. Even though they’re a bit like reading a horoscope, we can use these tests to gain insight into our strengths and weaknesses. You can search for tests like the Ocean Model, RHETI, or Meyers Briggs on the internet.  

The most important thing to remember is personality is not fixed. It's fluid and changes with time.
You get to choose who you want to be.
