#Psychometric testing

Psychometric testing is a fancy way of saying “personality test.” As stated earlier, it’s a full-blown pseudoscience. However, psychometrics do get something right: they showcase a wide variety of personality traits and behaviors. When we do these tests, we can read these traits and behaviors and see which ones resonate with us. 

In turn, we can recognize when specific emotions cause specific reactions. 

Take all these tests with a grain of salt, but pick and choose what resonates with you. The more you take of these tests, perhaps the more you’ll learn. Rather than seeing the personality categories as fitting you exactly, use your own discretion. 

There are a variety of tests that you can do to learn more about yourself. These following tests measure personality attributes. Even though they’re a bit like reading a horoscope, we can use these tests to gain insight into our strengths and weaknesses. You can search for tests like the Ocean Model, RHETI, or Meyers Briggs.
