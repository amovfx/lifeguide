#Psychometric testing

Psychometric testing is a fancy way of saying “personality test.” As stated earlier, 
it’s full-blown pseudoscience. Yet, what they do give insight into is a wide variety of personality 
traits and behaviors. When we do these tests, we can recognize our behavior better. 
 In turn, we can recognize when specific emotions cause specific reactions. Take 
all these tests with a grain of salt. **Your personality is not fixed at birth, and you can change anything about yourself that you want to.**
There are a variety of tests that you can do to learn more about yourself.

These following tests measure personality attributes. Ideal for dating sites and corporations training communication and teamwork
that want to generate vectors for machine learning models. 
Even though they are a bit like reading a horoscope, we 
can use these to gain insight into our strengths and weaknesses.
You can search for tests like the “Ocean Model”, RHETI or Meyers Briggs. 

Keep in mind, **personality is not fixed**, it is fluid, and you can shape yourself into whom you want to be.
