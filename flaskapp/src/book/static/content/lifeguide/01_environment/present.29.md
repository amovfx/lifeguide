 # The present


The present as of this writting is Janurary 2022. We are in what generational theory would call the end of an-unwinding. Or the start
of a crisis. In Nov 2019, JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup received a 4.5 trillion dollar bailout
from gambling on CDOs like the did in 2008. There is no mention this in any major news outlets.

On Janurary 6th, an attempted insurection took place in the United States Congress.

Meme stocks have been shorted to the tune of 2000%. A compounding financial crisis many times the size of 2008.

Covid Omicron variant is running rampany throughout the world filling hospitals.

The Great resignation is in full swing.

As you read this, I'm sure it is now history.


To understand our present situation, we look at two things. The exponetial decrease in cost per computation and
the proliferation of the internet.

These two things has put massive technological deflationary pressure on goods and services. If you are my age,
you remember the immense transformation that the internet had on the music and adverting industries.

This deflationary pressure comes from the automation of labor. In 2011, robot sales grew 43%. We are 
witnessing cascading effects in the economy as humans are replaced and unemployment rises. 
The economy demands a different set of skills
that were needed in the past. This has caused a rise in populism and a shift in a way people consume and produce.

This is the age of the prosumer. Historically, the costs of producing and distributing something were too high
for ordinary people. The production was centralized to a hand full of large conglomerates and companies. 
The internet has eliminated that barrier. Today, more than a third of the world's population distributes their own photots, art, films, music
and writing across the internet. Prosumers trade their goods and services globally or give them away for free.

 If we are looking to the future, we know that the uplift is next.
So this book is meant to enable you to position yourself
to gain as much as you can in order to help others.
