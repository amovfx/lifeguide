#The present

So where are we now?

We are in what generational theory would call ‘the end of an unwinding.’ Or, perhaps more accurately, the start of a crisis. In November 2019, JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup received a 4.5 trillion-dollar bailout from gambling on CDOs, just like they did in 2008. There was no mention this in any major news outlets.

On January 6th, an attempted insurrection took place in the United States Congress.

Various stocks, like gamestop, have been shorted to the tune of 2000%. A compounding financial crisis many times the size of 2008.

The COVID-19 crisis is still in full swing, and the less-deadly yet way more transmissible omicron variant of the illness is running rampant throughout the world, increasing case numbers and filling hospital beds. We’re in the midst of a public health crisis, and a deadly cocktail of obesity, sedentary lifestyles, drunk and alcohol abuse, poor diets, and poor sleep are wreaking havoc through our world. 

The Great Resignation is in full swing. People no longer accept working in traditional jobs. We live in a time where meaning is at a crises. Whenever meaning is about to form, most of us go back on our phones. Our collective existence is fragmentary. However, we’re also manipulated by algorithms, which push us content we’re more likely to interact with. Therefore, we’re left in echo chambers.

I wrote the above in January 2022. I wonder how much of this that I wrote is now history. Probably a flash in the pan, and the ‘new normal’ that the COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to will just be, well, normal. 

### Technological deflation

To understand our present situation, we must examine two things. 1) The exponential decrease in cost per computation, and 2) the proliferation of the internet.

These two things have put significant technological deflationary pressure on goods and services. If you are 31, like I was at the time of writing, I’m sure you remember the immense transformation that the internet had on the music and adverting industries.

This deflationary pressure comes from the automation of labour. In 2011, robot sales grew 43%. We are witnessing cascading effects in the economy as humans are replaced by robots causing rampant unemployment. The economy demands a different set of skills that were needed in the past. This has caused a rise in populism and a shift in a way people produce and consume.

This is the age of the prosumer. Historically, the costs of producing and distributing something were too high for ordinary people. The production was centralized to a handful of large conglomerates and companies. The internet has eliminated that barrier. Today, more than a third of the world's population distributes their own photos, art, films, music,
and writing across the internet. Prosumers trade their goods and services globally or give them away for free.

If we look to the future, we know that the uplift is next. The Life Guide will help you during that uplift and put you in pole position to deal with the next shift resulting that results from our current industrial revolution. In this pivotal role, you’ll be able to thrive, gain as much as you can, and be able to help others in the process. 

###The rigged game

With technological deflation pushing costs down, business interests are incentivized to collude to keep the prices up. Cabals are threatened and refuse to let go of the status quo.

The ‘blob’ is an informal term of a group of lobbyists and congressional staffers that work to push their mutual interests. We’ve got to find a way to wrestle back control so the governments function in our interests.
