#Understanding our environment

### Our cognitive realm

Now we’ve identified the skills that we want to develop in ourselves, we must learn how to use them to understand our objective reality.

By objective reality, I mean what’s true—what we can discern as fact. This is different than our subjective reality—the world inside our heads.

As we walk down the road of life, we find people and groups everywhere who want to tell us what the world’s—and the universe’s—true nature is. Let’s look at religion as an example. Various religions are in competition with other religions— they’re trying to sell their perspective. Each religion attempts to tie people to community to appeal to their sense of belonging. How? By hijacking our natural inclination to believe “there’s something bigger than us.” They may also offer that there’s a grand (or divine) plan to the universe, and that everything happens for a reason. This is often to make us feel better, to disregard the chaotic nature of the universe and find a way to impose or on it. Another perspective they might bring is that there’s life after death—and what you experience now is temporary—but your soul is eternal.

Religion, if you’ll allow me to be reductionist for a second, is a person or a bunch of people who write a few things down and once enough people believe it, it becomes true. 

Much of the world exists in our collective imagination. In other words, we’ve internalized our perceptions of the world and built ideas out of them which remain externally formless (though we could argue that the way neurons fire across synapses could be called a form). We built out abstract concepts which help us organize and coordinate. This is the superpower of humans—we can form collective narratives and turn them into missions and cooperate across vast distances.

Governments, money, religions, and corporations are all abstractions that spring from the well of our collective consciousness. They’re also ways that we try to impose order on our environment using systems. The problem with systems made up of humans? They’re imperfect by nature. This is why it’s essential to get a more objective understanding of the world, so we can make the best possible decisions.

Governments don't objectively exist, humans just wrote down some rules and knew a system was needed to maintain them. As we form quite naturally into hierarchies, we try to solve larger problems—like existing in a country as a collective—using hierarchies as part of the solution. But hierarchies can be more in the realm of orderly or more in the realm of chaos. They can be democratically established or established through force, breeding authoritarianism. 

Money is often people agreeing over an object that is fixed supply, fungible, divisible, and portable. Our journey with ‘money’ has gone from seashells, precious metals, paper, and now exist in database entries. 

We create a subjective reality for a large group of people that serves their sense of belonging and purpose. Government. Corporations are another layer on top of governments, they exist in the realm of 'legal fiction.' Let’s get reductionist again: all we need to do is create a document called the articles of incorporation to spawn a corporation. Wham! Now we understand the abstraction of a business/enterprise. 

If everyone suddenly disappeared, the governments, their political parties, currencies, religions, and corporations no longer exist. Unless you’re persuaded by the philosophy that things can only exist if they have an entity to perceive it (think “if a tree falls in the forest, and no one’s around to hear it, does it make a sound?”), then rocks will still exist in their (temporary) form. 


Due to their nature of existing in our collective imagination, governments, corporations, and the like require a high degree of trust. Trust is one of the most powerful traits we humans have. Our entire civilization is rooted in it. It happens on the micro scale all the way up to the macro scale. The governments and the religions are only as strong as people believe them to be. When the trust starts to deteriorate, those institutions start to falter. 

One problem is that the requirement of trust in the positions high up in the hierarchical food-chain is like a moth gazing at a bright light—attractive to the most corrupt and self-serving people in our society. The result is often a vicious feedback loop. Untrustworthy people operating in previously trustworthy entities. This is what leads to chaos. 

For most of our history, these collective cognitive conjurations have served us well for the most part, increased our prosperity, provided
security, and allowed us to cooperate. It’s given rise to—historically speaking at least—relatively peaceful civilization. 

Our current population is 8 billion people. We are facing a wide array of seemingly intractable problems.

But what can we do about the propensity for low levels of trust?

Unfortunately, we have evolved to lie because lying can drive group cohesion and is a useful tool for climbing the proverbial ladder. If we lie that we are in control of ourselves, other people tend to flock to us because they feel out of control. The problem is, when people collectively project their insecurities about lack of control onto someone who acts secure about their control—that individual doesn’t notice the shadow character that forms behind them, strengthens, and takes on its own personality. The individual with the large shadow acts out this personality but is ignorant of it. 

So, one of the huge problems are that we also evolved to believe the lie. People we follow often hide the truth of the brutal violent world that we evolved from. Think about it—how often do you hear politicians or religious leaders say, “I don’t know, to be honest,” as a truthful response rather than a deceitful one?

Lies are the glue of institutions that exist on our collective cognition. Or so it would seem.

This may sound dire, but I hope to ensure that the opposite ensues. Each one of us owns these institutions—they belong to me and you. If we work together, we can reshape them to properly serve us. Alternatively, with the power of the internet, we can just replace them and build our own.

No matter what some of our spiritual guides say, we only have one objective reality, but we come at that reality from an infinity of subjective ones. That’s the nuance we need to grasp if we’re to move forward. It’s not an either/or situation. It’s a both/and situation. We must grasp our subjectivities and act with objectivity as the goal. 

So, to start, we must all accept that we’re playing the same game. But to play properly, we’ve got to learn the rules.
 
### Generational Theory

[ACTION ITEM FOR ANDREW: This part is lifted from Wikipedia. Could you paraphrase how you want to say it, then I can go in and edit? Needs to be in your voice.]

The Strauss–Howe generational theory, devised by William Strauss and Neil Howe, describes a theorized recurring generation cycle in American and global history. According to the theory, historical events are associated 
with recurring generational personas (archetypes). Each generational persona unleashes a new era (a turning), lasting around 20–25 years, in which a new social, political, and economic climate (mood) exists. Each 25-year cycle are part of a larger cyclical (a "saeculum"—a long human life, which usually spans between 80 and 100 years, although some saecula have lasted longer). The theory states that a crisis recurs in American history after every saeculum, which is followed by a recovery (high). During this recovery, institutions and communitarian values are strong. Ultimately, succeeding generational archetypes attack and weaken institutions in the name of autonomy and individualism, which eventually creates a tumultuous political environment that ripens conditions for another crisis.

Strauss and Howe laid the groundwork for their theory in their 1991 book, ‘Generations,’ which discusses the history of the United States as a series of generational biographies going back to 1584.[1] In their 1997 book, ‘The Fourth Turning,’ the authors expanded the theory to focus on a fourfold cycle of generational types and recurring mood eras[2] to describe the history of the United States, including the Thirteen Colonies and their British antecedents. However, the authors have also examined generational trends elsewhere in the world and described similar cycles in several developed countries.[3]

Academic response to the theory has been mixed. Some applaud Strauss and Howe for their "bold and imaginative thesis" and others criticize it for being overly-deterministic, unfalsifiable, and unsupported by rigorous evidence.[4][5][6][7][8] Strauss–Howe generational theory has also been 
described by some historians and journalists as pseudoscientific.[6][9][10] "kooky",[11] and "an elaborate 
historical horoscope that will never withstand scholarly scrutiny."[12][13][14] Academic criticism has focused on 
the lack of rigorous empirical evidence for their claims,[15] and the authors' view that generational groupings are more powerful than other social groupings such as economic class, race, sex, religion, and political parties.[16]

Strauss and Howe define a social generation as the aggregate of all people born over a span of roughly twenty years or about the length of one phase of life: childhood, young adulthood, midlife, and old age. Generations are identified (from first birthyear to last) by looking for cohort groups of this length that share three criteria. First, members of a generation share what the authors call an age location in history: they encounter key historical events and social trends while occupying the same phase of life. In this view, members of a generation are shaped in lasting ways by the eras they encounter as children and young adults and they share certain common beliefs and behaviors. Aware of the experiences and traits that they share with their peers, members of a generation would also share a sense of common perceived membership in that generation.[34]

What’s great about this, according to these guys, is that we’re about to encounter a high. Something that I call Renaissance 2.0. I'm sure you
can see how the generational theory has a very strong influence (((((NOTE FROM NATHAN:::: INFLUENCE ON WHAT?))))))

So how did we get here? Let’s take a look at our past to understand our present.

To do this effectively, we must turn to logic and reason.

Then, we must look to our past and understand how we developed. 
Once we know our history, we gain context for the present, and once we connect the two, we can spot large trends and position us accordingly.
