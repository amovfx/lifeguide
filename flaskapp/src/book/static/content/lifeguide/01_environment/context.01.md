#Understanding our environment

### Our cognitive realm
As we have identified our skills that we want to develop in ourselves. We want to use them to understand our objective reality.

We go through life, and everyone wants to tell us the narrative of the world. Various religions compete for memebers
by offering a different story that ties people to community to appeal to our sense of belonging.

So much of the world we know, simply live on our collective imagination. Abstract concepts are constructed to help us organize
and coordinate. This is the super power of humans. To form a collective narrative that enables cooperation across vast 
distances.

Governments, money, religions, corporations are all abstractions from our collective consciousness. They
are entities of a cognitive realm if you will.
Governments don't objectively exist,
we simply wrote down some rules, and everyone agreed to follow in a democracy, others are coerced through force. 
Money is often people agreeing over an object that is fixed supply, fungible, divisible and portable. This journey
has gone from sea shells, precious metals, paper and now database entries. Religions
are really the same thing, people write a few things down and once enough people believe it, it becomes true. 
A subjective reality is created for a large 
group of people that serves their sense of belonging and purpose. Corporations, are another layer on top of governments, 
they exist in the realm of 'legal fiction'.
We created a document called the articles of incorporation to spawn a corporation.

If everyone suddenly disappeared, the governments, their political parties, currencies, religions and corporations no 
longer exist.


Due to their nature of existing on our collective imagination, they require a high degree of trust. Trust is one of the 
most powerful attributes we have. Our entire civilization is rooted in it.The 
governments and the religions are only as strong as people believe them to be. When the trust starts to deteriorate,
those institutions start to falter. Furthermore, the requirement of trust in the positions are absolutely magnetic
to the most corrupt and self-serving people in our society. A vicious feedback loop ensues.

For the majority of our history, these collective cognitive conjurations have mostly served us well, and increased our prosperity, provided
security, and provided a means to cooperate. We are now at 8 billion people and facing a wide array of seemingly intractable problems.
It looks like trust doesn't scale.
We are evolved to lie because lying can drive group cohesion and is a useful tool for climbing the ladder.
We are also evolved to believe the lie. They hide us from the truth of the brutal violent world that we evolved from.

It is the glue of the institutions that exist on our collective cognition. 

This may sound dire, but I hope to convey the opposite. We own these insitutions, if we can work together, we can reshape
them to properly serve us. Or, now with the power of the internet, we can just replace them and build our own.

Regardless, of our spiritual guides, we all live in one shared objective reality. Where we came from before and where we go after 
doesn't matter. We are all playing the same game and we have to learn the rules.

### Generational Theory

The Strauss–Howe generational theory, devised by William Strauss and Neil Howe, describes a theorized recurring 
generation cycle in American history and global history. According to the theory, historical events are associated 
with recurring generational personas (archetypes). Each generational persona unleashes a new era (called a turning) 
lasting around 20–25 years, in which a new social, political, and economic climate (mood) exists. They are part of a 
larger cyclical "saeculum" (a long human life, which usually spans between 80 and 100 years, although some saecula 
have lasted longer). The theory states that a crisis recurs in American history after every saeculum, 
which is followed by a recovery (high). During this recovery, institutions and communitarian values are strong. 
Ultimately, succeeding generational archetypes attack and weaken institutions in the name of autonomy and individualism, 
which eventually creates a tumultuous political environment that ripens conditions for another crisis.

Strauss and Howe laid the groundwork for their theory in their 1991 book Generations, which discusses the history 
of the United States as a series of generational biographies going back to 1584.[1] In their 1997 book The Fourth 
Turning, the authors expanded the theory to focus on a fourfold cycle of generational types and recurring mood eras[2] 
to describe the history of the United States, including the Thirteen Colonies and their British antecedents. However, 
the authors have also examined generational trends elsewhere in the world and described similar cycles in several 
developed countries.[3]

Academic response to the theory has been mixed—some applauding Strauss and Howe for their "bold and imaginative thesis" 
and others criticizing the theory as being overly-deterministic, unfalsifiable, 
and unsupported by rigorous evidence,[4][5][6][7][8] Strauss–Howe generational theory has also been 
described by some historians and journalists as pseudoscientific.[6][9][10] "kooky",[11] and "an elaborate 
historical horoscope that will never withstand scholarly scrutiny."[12][13][14] Academic criticism has focused on 
the lack of rigorous empirical evidence for their claims,[15] and the authors' view that generational groupings are 
more powerful than other social groupings such as economic class, race, sex, religion, and political parties.[16]

Strauss and Howe define a social generation as the aggregate of all people born over a span of roughly twenty years or about the length of one phase of life: childhood, young adulthood, midlife, and old age. Generations are identified (from first birthyear to last) by looking for cohort groups of this length that share three criteria. First, members of a generation share what the authors call an age location in history: they encounter key historical events and social trends while occupying the same phase of life. In this view, members of a generation are shaped in lasting ways by the eras they encounter as children and young adults and they share certain common beliefs and behaviors. Aware of the experiences and traits that they share with their peers, members of a generation would also share a sense of common perceived membership in that generation.[34]

Whats great about this, according to these guys, we are coming up to a high. Something that I call Renesaince 2.0. I'm sure you
can see how the generational theory has a very strong influence 

So how did we get here? Lets take a look at our past to understand our present.

The fourth turning

Homo Spaiens.



In order to do this effectively, we must turn to logic and reason.

Then we must look to our past and understand how we developed. 
Once we know our history, we gain context for the present, once we connect the two, we can spot large trends
and position us accordingly.
