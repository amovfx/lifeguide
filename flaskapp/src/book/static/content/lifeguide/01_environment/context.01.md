### Our cognitive realm

Now we’ve identified the skills that we want to develop in ourselves, we must learn how to use them to understand our objective reality.

By objective reality, I mean what’s true (what we can identify as a fact). This is different than our subjective reality—the world inside our heads.

As we climb the mountain of life, we find people and groups everywhere who want to tell us what the world’s—and the universe’s—true nature is. 

Let’s look at religion as an example. Various religions are in competition with other religions—they’re trying to sell their perspective. Each religion attempts to tie people to community to appeal to their sense of belonging. How? By hijacking our natural inclination to believe ‘there’s something bigger than us.’ They may also say there’s a grand (or divine) plan to the universe, and that everything happens for a reason. This is often to make us feel better, to disregard the chaotic nature of the universe and find a way to impose our will on it. They may also promise life after death.

Religion, if you’ll allow me to be reductionist for a second, is a person or a bunch of people who wrote a few things down that affected culture and human belief long term. In short, when enough people believe it, it becomes psychologically true for them, but not objectively true. 

Much of the world exists in our collective imagination. In other words, we’ve internalized our perceptions of the world and built ideas out of them which remain externally formless (though we could argue that the way neurons fire across synapses could be considered a form). We built out abstract concepts which help us organize and coordinate. This is the superpower of humans—we can form collective narratives and turn them into missions and cooperate across vast distances to achieve them.

Governments, money, religions, and corporations are all abstractions that spring from the well of our collective consciousness. They’re also ways that we try to impose order on our environment through the use of systems. The problem with systems made up of humans? They’re imperfect. Therefore, it’s essential to get a more objective understanding of the world, so we can make the best possible decisions.

Governments don't objectively exist, humans just wrote down some rules and knew a system was needed to maintain them. As we form naturally into hierarchies, we try to solve larger problems—like existing and cooperating in a nation as a collective—using hierarchies as part of the solution. But hierarchies can be more in the realm of orderly or more in the realm of chaos. They can be democratically established or established through force, breeding authoritarianism. 

Money is often people agreeing over an object that is in fixed supply, fungible, divisible, and portable. Our journey with ‘money’ has gone from seashells, precious metals, paper, all the way to the now—database entries. 

We create a subjective reality for a large group of people that serves their sense of belonging and purpose through government. Corporations are another layer on top of governments, and they exist in the realm of 'legal fiction.' Let’s get reductionist again: all we need to do is create a document called the articles of incorporation to spawn a corporation. Wham! Now we understand the abstract basics of a business/enterprise. 

If everyone suddenly disappeared, the governments, their political parties, currencies, religions, and corporations no longer exist. 

Due to their nature of existing in our collective imagination, governments, corporations, and the like require a high degree of trust. Trust is one of the most powerful traits we humans have. Our entire civilization is rooted in trust. It happens on the micro scale all the way up to the macro scale. The governments and the religions are only as strong as people believe them to be. When the trust starts to deteriorate, those institutions start to falter. 

One problem is that the requirement of trust in the positions high up in the hierarchical food-chain is that it attracts the most corrupt and self-serving people in our society. The result is often a vicious feedback loop. Untrustworthy people operating in previously trustworthy entities. This leads to chaos. 

For most of our history, these collective cognitive conjurations have served us well for the most part, increased our prosperity, provided
security, and allowed us to cooperate. It’s given rise to—historically speaking, at least—relatively peaceful civilizations. 

Our current population is 8 billion people. We are facing a wide array of seemingly intractable problems.

But what can we do about the propensity for low levels of trust?

Unfortunately, we have evolved to lie because lying can drive group cohesion and is a useful tool for climbing the proverbial mountain. If we lie that we are in control of ourselves, other people tend to flock to us because they feel out of control. The problem is, when people collectively project their insecurities about lack of control onto someone who acts secure about their control—that individual doesn’t notice the shadow character that forms behind them, strengthens, and takes on its own personality. The individual with the large shadow acts out this personality without knowledge of it. 

So, one of the huge problems are that we also evolved to believe the lie. People we follow often hide the truth of the violent world that we evolved from. Think about it—how often do you hear politicians or religious leaders say, “I don’t know, to be honest,” as a truthful response rather than a deceitful one?

Lies are the glue of institutions that exist on our collective cognition. Or so it would seem.

This may sound dire, but I hope to ensure that the opposite ensues. Each one of us owns these institutions—they belong to me and you. If we work together, we can reshape them to properly serve us. Alternatively, with the power of the internet, we can just replace them and build our own.

No matter what some of our spiritual guides say, we only have one objective reality, but we come at that reality from an infinity of subjective ones. That’s the nuance we need to grasp if we’re to move forward. It’s not an either/or situation. It’s a both/and situation. We must grasp our subjectivities and act with objectivity as the goal. 

So, to start, we must all accept that we’re playing the same game. But to play properly, we’ve got to learn the rules.
 
### Generational Theory

“Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, 
good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times.” 
The quote, from a postapocalyptic novel by the author G. Michael Hopf, 
sums up a stunningly pervasive cyclical vision of history.

This is elaborated upon by William Strauss and Niel Howe that describe a theory of a generational cycle in American and global history.

They make a generational persona, called an archetype. Each archetype starts a new era, which they call a turning, a 20–25 year period where a new social, political and economic climate emerges. There are four of these periods in a saeculum, a long human life, between 80-100 years.

At the end of every saeculum, there is a crisis, which is then followed by a recovery. It’s a cycle between individualism and collectivism. When the institutional and communal strength grows, the following archetype weakens these in the name of autonomy and individualism which fosters the climate for another cycle.

The academic review is mixed. The cycle is lauded as a creative viewpoint to some, and others criticize it for being overly-deterministic,  unfalsifiable, and unsupported by rigorous evidence. It's hard to measure a claim that a generational social grouping is stronger than a grouping for economic class, race, sex, religion, and political parties.

In short, our collective memory doesn't go past 100 years. The COVID-19 pandemic is a perfect case study. All the people that lived the lessons
of the Spanish Flu in the 1920s are dead. They aren't around to tell their great great grandchildren how badly they screwed up. They did much of the same dumb shit the anti-mask parties did. The parallels are stunning. Like Mark Twain once quipped, “History Doesn't Repeat Itself, but It Often Rhymes.”

Once we know our history, we gain context for the present, and once we connect the two, we can spot large trends and position us accordingly.
