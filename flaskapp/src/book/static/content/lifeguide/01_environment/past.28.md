# Our history

There’s a famous saying that history doesn't repeat, but it sure does rhyme. What I hope to show is there’s a pattern in the evolution of our collective memory that revolves around our (if I can borrow a computer science term) data storage capabilities. When I study history, I view it in the context of our collective record keeping capabilities. Our collective memory is what controls the present, and within it are the tools we can use to build a better future.

#The beginnings of civilization

For most of our history, our collective memory and essential information was passed down through stories. The power
of the story helped us understand our world to navigate it better.

Human memory is fallible. Think about your own memory—you don’t remember every day you’ve had, everything you’ve ever worn, your own birth, or plenty of other things (blackout drunk, anyone?). So collective memory is even more fallible, though some stories can be solidified even though they’re deeply in the realm of myth. As our human stories transfer from elder to elder, they can easily be modified for the next generation so that it passes down with seamless ease. In that situation, the power the elders have over the young is near absolute.

This was the way things were done for about 170,000 years. About,10 000 years ago, modern anthropomorphic humans migrated from Africa into the regions of Mesopotamia (modern day Iran), Syria, and Turkey. It was here humans began farming. Thus, the agricultural revolution was born.

During this time, people were trading on a consistent basis. So it was essential humans could keep track of who owes what good to who. So, we invented counting. Because counting is so innate to us now, it sounds absurd that humans needed to acquire this mental technology—but we did. 

This would be the first instance in modern set theory, the study of a collection or set of objects. In that time period, there were big baskets of stuff, and there were small baskets of stuff. The first evidence of this counting was through a technology called proto-cuneiform. Cells had pictures full of dots to denominate the number of goods. As absurd as this sounds, one of the first inventions humans ever made was the spreadsheet.

From counting came writing, and the first writing was cuneiform. Cuneiform is called script, and cuneiform evolved to clay packets for contracts. Though it wasn’t possible to write poetry with it, it was extremely effective for accounting.

Once we could account properly, we could now trade. Our first civilizations were born from a need to settle ownership of these records. Today, writing and counting is something everyone’s expected to learn in the modern world, and most of us have numerical and reading/writing literacy. During the times of the agricultural revolution, writing was a highly paid profession reserved for the nobility. From this invention, humanity blossomed from nomadic tribes to an agrarian civilization. It increased our capability to specialize.



#The renaissance

The renaissance was a period where cultures started to mix. Where classical philosophy, literature, and art were promoted.

During this time, information proliferated due to the printing press, invented in 1040 in China (and invented independently in Europe just under 400 years later). The printing press is the invention that super charged our record-keeping capabilities and birthed bureaucracy.

Between 1200 and 1350, double entry accounting was invented in northern Italy. This innovation to the ledger, used since
the beginning of our civilization, spawned capitalism. The result? Our entire civilization reorganized. 

Then came the industrial revolutions.

#Industrial Revolutions


Industrial revolutions were exactly as they sound: revolutionary. They completely changed the fabric of our society. Industrial revolutions happen when there’s a convergence of three industrial sectors: energy, transport, and communications. 

Economic historians tend to agree that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals and plants.[15]

Domesticated animal power (energy), the wheel (transport), and the invention of writing (communication).

Steam and waterpower (energy), the train (transport), and the telegraph (communication).

Oil (energy), automobiles and planes (transport), and the telephone communication).

Nuclear (energy), rockets (transport), satellite communications (communication).

So where are we now? Renewables (energy), self-driving cars and drones (transport), and the ever-faster internet (communication).

When you think about how fast human civilization has been evolving, it’s mind-boggling. Not too long ago, there was no internet. No one had a “smart” phone which has enough computing power to rival the best computers on the planet just 15 to 20 years ago. We couldn’t connect with other people in distant lands without traveling there. And Google was just a funny-sounding word…

It wasn’t long ago that we were trading beads for feathers with one another. Most of our evolutionary time that man has been in existence was spent in the nomadic period.

Evolutionary psychology and the power of abstraction allows us to cooperate with one another, but the problem is that powerful big tech companies are causing much more harm than good by suppressing information. Case in point, whistle blower and ex-Google employee Zach Vorhies went public with information about how Google blacklists websites. As they say, power corrupts, and absolute power over information corrupts absolutely. 

But how did we get here? And what does the future hold for us? 
Let’s quickly look at how we started, the three industrial revolutions, before diving deep into the fourth one. 

### Nomadic Period: 190,000 BC to 10,000 BC

In our relatively short existence as humans, our longest period was the nomadic period. Nomad means not having a permanent address and following herds of animals as they migrate. That should give you some perspective as to how fast we’re evolving. In other words, we spent most of our evolutionary time as nomads in this organizational structure. Industrial revolutions restructured our civilization.

The difficult thing to understand our humanity during our nomadic years is that no one knew how to write. We have some cave paintings but no records. Because of our ability to construct stories, we could achieve a goal (like a cooperative hunt) but we couldn’t communicate over large distances (or time spans).

Remember, an industrial revolution happens when a revolution in communications, transportation, and energy happens. So, if we look at the first one that brought us out from the plains into an agrarian society, that would be cuneiform, our first form of writing, the wheel which enabled transport, pottery, and fire (PLEASE ELABORATE RE: POTTERY AND FIRE). Writing assisted our ability to build abstractions upon our collective imagination. Once those technologies converged, we had an industrial revolution. 

### The First Industrial Revolution: 1765

Mechanization was the biggest change for the first industrial revolution. The mechanization of agriculture and the invention of the steam engine helped spur on the first industrial revolution. The extraction of coal was also a major contributor. This new type of energy later helped in the manufacturing of trains and railroads. 

### The Second Industrial Revolution: 1870

About a century later after the first industrial revolution, the second one came in the form of oil, gas, and electricity. The internal combustion engine was invented, along with the telephone, the telegraph, chemical synthesis, and the production of steel. The most important inventions were the automobile and the airplane. I firmly believe the second industrial revolution was the most important one. 

### The Third Industrial Revolution: 1969

Nuclear energy starts us off with the third industrial revolution. This third industrial revolution created electronics, telecommunications, and computers. It brought us biotechnology, space expeditions, and research. It also brought us Robots and PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) which are giving us increasing levels of automation. 
It also brought us Google, social media, the ability to connect with others around the world instantly, and about 6,000 other scientific inventions that have been suppressed by government agencies to protect fossil fuel holdings and other interests.
