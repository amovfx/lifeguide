# The Future

The next generation economy will be founded upon different specialized internets. These will work together and intertwine to give humanity far lower costs in production, increase global access, and drive prosperity for all.

You could also see these as additional layers in our communications internet. But why has this been the case? Mainly because there’s been an exponential drop in the price of computation.

We have a vastly stronger collective memory than ever before because of the internet, and it’s coupled with an immutable decentralized ledger. This should enable us to break the cycle of the narcissistic generation and the 100-year cycles we subject ourselves to. 

The idea of this book is to enable as many people as possible to benefit from the impending upswing to get into positions to benefit future generations and break our generational cycle with a stronger and globally accessible collective memory.


###Monetary Internet

The monetary internet was made possible by Bitcoin. At its heart, Bitcoin is an algorithmic solution to settlement. It was long thought to be an impossible pipe-dream, but the improbable happened. What Bitcoin has enabled is the update and verification of a decentralized database. It has also allowed us to make payments, using the internet, without a trace.

Traditionally, highly regulated banks practiced settlement. This settlement process was expensive and slow. Now, prosumers have an additional tool in their belt to lower costs further. 

Prosumers no longer need to open a bank to conduct business. The monetary network in cryptocurrency [Andrew: check for accuracy] will span the globe and has near zero operating costs. It will be made up of a few layers, consisting of specialized blockchains connected though lightning networks. This is like how our communications network evolved. Ethernet is a broadcast network, and TCP/IP is the routing layer. Blockchains are broadcast networks and lightning networks are routing networks like TCP/IP. We will be transferring value around the world without banks. We’ll spend our money freely without the government looking over our shoulder.

###Energy Internet

As green energy rises, a growing portion of the energy market will fall to prosumers instead of monolithic electric companies. Again, look at the added advantage the prosumer gets with solar panels on their house. Production costs of these panels will drop even further! 

It all really starts to get crazy when you combine the energy internet with the monetary network. Lightning networks can package communications alongside a payment. In other words, your lightbulb can publish a smart contract to purchase electricity from your neighbours’ solar panels or vice versa. The future is a place where light bulbs will be bidding for their electricity use and solar panels will bill consumer devices directly.

###Logistics Internet

Self-driving cars are already among us, but they’re not yet widespread or at the level of sophistication they’re likely to be. It doesn't take much of a mental leap to picture a world where drivers are entirely replaced with machines, and car driving will be some quirky thing someone’s ancestors did. 

Therefore, the delivery of physical goods will drop further for producers as goods deliveries will be entirely automated and, likely, even faster than they are now.  

Currently, one of our biggest problems in our supply chains is storage. Warehouses are owned by individual suppliers and not even full. Trucks are 60% full. The energy internet will optimize this and ensure no space is wasted. 

###Material Internet

Breakthroughs in 3D printing will revolutionize manufacturing. Communities will have their own 3D printer. The goods that you print will be able to be recycled back into 3D printers. This will cut accessibility to goods even further down, and prices will continue to drop. 

###Internet of Things

Due to the monetary internet, machines can pay each other. Once again, costs will drop even further!

When you pay a self-driving car to deliver some materials you 3D printed, it’ll use those funds to purchase electricity directly from a windmill or solar panel. It will also be able to purchase software upgrades that make it more efficient. In this vision of the future, machines will be able to sustain themselves. For example, if a bulb’s light goes out, it will automatically order its replacement from a 3D printer. If it’s not being used, it could sell its electricity back to the grid and even give itself in for recycling. 

It really is mind-blowing what will eventually happen in our future world.
