# Financial Management

This is one of the most important chapters. Now that we know how to create an autonomous mindset and
know how to create good habits, we want to apply that to finances. A strong financial foundation
enables you more freedom to pursue your endeavors. Getting good at this, really excersizes your willpower. There is
a lot of "I will" and "I won't".

It is very easy to fall into a trap where you have no money to save and are buried by interests on debts. If you are in 
this position, your top priority needs to be getting out and will require 100% focus. Anything that you are doing, 
that isn't getting you out of this tough spot needs to be stopped.

### Pay Yourself First
First, to gain financial mastery, we must get into the habit of paying ourselves first. That means saving money with 
every income stream you have into an account that you don't touch for a very long time.

Also, once you get a nest egg in place, get a safety net which will reduce your fear and allow you to 
take risks. If you don’t save while you earn, you’ll never be able to get your money to work for you. 
Start with saving 1% of our gross income and increase it from there.  Practice saving more and spending less. 
Understanding your motivators will help you identify if you are spending for 
a reason that is beneficial to your long term future.

To motivate ourselves to save, think about what we value. Is it travel? Is it financial independence? Visualize 
already having what you want, then start working to make it come true. 
On financial goals, you don’t have to try to figure out exactly what it should be. You can even guess what 
your goals should be and then fine-tune the goal as you go. Your goals are not set in stone. 
Another point is to make sure that you know where you are now financially. Assess your current financial situation 
by making a balance sheet of assets and liabilities. When you have a clear picture of where you are, you can proceed 
with confidence. 

### Budget

It’s a great idea to make a budget so that you can track your spending. Find the tools that give you visibility into your finances. 
There are lots of budgeting tools out there. The key is to have your eyes on it by looking at them at a regular interval.
Make a budget and track your spending. Save as much as you can and view paying off debts as a form of investment. 
For example, if your highest interest credit card is 25% and you have a savings account that pays only 3%, it 
doesn’t make any sense to have ANY balance amount on the 25% credit card. Pay that off first and do your best to 
never carry a balance on high-interest credit cards. Always pay off the debt you have which has the highest amount 
of interest first. Once you become financially stable, you can move onto focusing on investing.

There is no way that this eBook can do that topic 
justice because it’s such a big one. When we invest our time into this topic, identifying subject-matter experts is a skill in itself.
You need to make sure you don't succumb to your cognitive biases discussed earlier. Like nutrition, this area is rife with charlatans.
