#Environment

As humans, we have the ability to reshape our environment to our will to a great degree. We want to put this natural ability
to work so we can reach our goals as quick as possible. The common term for this is Feng Shui.


We are products of our environment. So lets build an environment enables a virtuous cycle in our personal development.
As we grow, we will reshape our environment to better suit our needs.

Your brain can only focus on a limited amount of stimuli at a time.
We have something called brain width, our brains are only able to focus on a limited about of stimuli at a time. By 
altering our environment, we can remove distractions and enhance our focus.

Set a designated place for every single object. Being organized saves you time, when you need something, you know exactly
where it is and don't have to waste time searching for it. If you would like to get better at this, whenever you enter a room,
and you see something or many things out of place, start with putting two things back where they belong.

This same thing applies to our ideas, and our data. Organize your ideas out-side of your head to conserve mental energy.
Make sure your computing and communications environment is organized as well. You want to have strong tools for managing
your incoming communications and your outgoing communications. There is only so much you can store in  your head, you 
have to write things down in regular places. We will expand on this in the data management section.

Set aside time to refuel and organize your environment for long term time savings. Like everything here, this is just another 
positive habit to be built. Investing the time, a few times a week, pays dividends down the road. 

If possible, make your goals have a separate environment. If you like to play video games but work on the same machine, 
that is a risky and non-optimal combo, when you walk in your office, it is for your projects only, make your entertainment area
separate where you can relax and recharge.
