# Fear and Failure

Fear is a powerful emotion that under the right circumstances can benefit us. For example,
in a forest fire ,you need to run to safety, fear could give you a boost of energy to run fast enough to 
escape. Your brain dumps a lot of adrenalin and cortisol into your system to give you that extra boost of 
energy. 
Fear, activates the evolutionary older parts of the brain, the lower lembic system. This uses the nutrients from your blood which 
deprives your cerebral cortex of what it needs to function. Thats where your critical thinking happens. Also, blood flow goes to your extremities
to take physical action. Rational thought becomes difficult when you are in a state of fear or anger. I'm sure you can see how this is used
in the main stream media which pumps a steady stream of fear and outrage to dull our critical thinking.

For most of us, fear shows up in lots of other areas in our lives besides running from forest fires and 
saber-toothed tigers and offers no benefit. For example, most of us are fearful of public speaking. The 
problem is that our brain conflates running from a forest fire and public speaking. One is a 
legitimate fear that helps, and the other is an unfounded fear that doesn’t help. We have outgrown our evolutionary roots that got us here.

**We can learn to use fear as a compass to drive our personal growth.** We can decide to move towards our fear, not away.

### Unfounded Fear Roots

In every case of unfounded fear, there is an event from the past that caused it to take root. For example, if when you 
were child you had to give a speech in class, but you did poor and people laughed at you. Feeling shame, you convince 
yourself that you are not good at it. A few years later, at another speech you're rediculed again, neural pathways further 
enforce that you aren't good at it. 
Then, if you did nothing to change that unfounded fear and belief that you’re not a good public speaker, when you get 
into adulthood, you would likely have the same fear of public speaking.

But the problem is that it was your childhood brain and mind that decided such an important thing. It wasn’t a rational, 
cognitive unbiased decision by your adult mind. For this reason, we should challenge all the negative beliefs and fears 
that we have from our adult mindset – not the childhood one. Cultivate skills and conquer fears.

### Mastering Failure

If you have an unfounded fear, ask yourself when you first got the fear. Challenge it. Talk to yourself in a logical 
way that sets your mind at ease relative to the fear. What you want to do is to reprogram your mind using logic and 
reasoning to calm its fears. 

Change can also ignite fear. So, if you are changing, you are going to need good fear management techniques so you can 
use your higher-level brain functions to shape your life into what you want.
Make a Disaster Report
Face your fears immediately and put them into your own personal disaster report. This is a basic risk assessment concept 
that anyone can use. Here are the steps:
Clearly describe your fear.
Determine your worst-case scenario. 
Write it down.
Find a solution to the worst-case scenario.
Do everything in your power to avoid the worst-case scenario.

### Failure as the Way

Failure is part of the journey to success. Failure is inevitable and is a critical part of moving forward.
But also, failure opens up new opportunities. When one door closes, another one is open. 
Learning from failure is instrumental to success. What if Einstein had given up the instant that his first experiment 
failed? What if the Wright brothers gave up on the idea of flying when it first didn’t work? When you try something that 
doesn't work, now you know what doesn't work! It’s simple common sense. 
Overcoming the fear of failure to take new risks brings long-term success. It’s the fear of failure that gets to so many 
of us, and that is an unfounded fear that is usually based upon our experience in the “failed” educational system. 
They didn't prepare us for real life! 
Failure is also a discovery of a competence and knowledge boundary. It will highlight for you what you need to work harder at.  
It will let you know when you need to know more. And there’s nothing wrong with trying something new and failing at it. 
How else are you going to learn? 
So much of it is about mindset. The fear of failure can keep you from many wonderful experiences. 
Don’t ever be afraid to try anything that you are even the least bit curious about. That is the joy of life. Try it, 
fail, and then try again until you get it. 
That is the process of life!

### Relabeling success
As we begin this journey, we take on new and exciting challenges. Some that will be quite difficult. We will come to setbacks,
we will break our commitments to ourselves, we will miss things on our schedules, but in the end we will get back on track. 
Not for anyone else, but for ourselves.
That is what success really looks like, it is building your grit to push pass failures and disappointments. It isn't about the
destination, it is about the journey.
