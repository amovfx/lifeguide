This is the end of Part 1: Autonomy. We have covered how to analyze yourself so that you can get a 
baseline understanding of where you are right now, and we covered the autonomous mindset and how to develop it. 
Now, let’s discuss how to master different aspects of life.
PART 2: Mastery

In this PART 2: Mastery, we focus on mastering many aspects of your life that are key for you to 
create an autonomous life. This part is focused on mastering our inner game first before we attempt 
to master our environment.
We cover it all here: health, habits, focus, fears, failure, time, goals, and finances. 
Once you master most if not all of these, you’ll have mastered your life. 
The rule of thumb is, if you do not invest the time, you do not achieve your goals. Invest in yourself now and you’ll reap the rewards for the rest of your life. 

Health is the most important aspect of your life. If you lose your health, nothing else matters. 
And by staying in good shape now, you can avoid costly medical bills in the future.  
To maintain good health, you must exercise, get plenty of sleep and watch what you eat. 
Let’s cover these topics now.
