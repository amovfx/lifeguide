PART 2: Mastery

In this PART 2: Mastery, we focus on mastering many aspects of your life that are key for you to 
create an autonomous life. This part is focused on mastering our inner game first before we attempt 
to master our environment.
We cover it all here: health, habits, focus, fears, failure, time, goals, and finances. 
Once you master most if not all of these, you’ll have mastered your life. 
The rule of thumb is, if you do not invest the time, you do not achieve your goals. Invest in yourself now and 
you’ll reap the rewards for the rest of your life. You get what you focus on.

Health is the most important aspect of our lives. If we lose our health, nothing else matters.
To maintain good health, we must exercise, get plenty of sleep and watch what we eat. It is a virtuous feedback loop.
By staying in good shape now, we can spend more time with your loved ones and avoid costly medical bills in the future.
