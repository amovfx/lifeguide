# Welcome to the life guide!

Dear Reader,

You?re likely here because you know you?re capable of more in your life, and you?re searching for something to help elevate you to the next stage in your journey. 

We?re all at different altitudes on the collective mountain of life. Some of us are halfway up. Many of us at the base, ready with our gear, tents, and food supplies, about to climb. Most of us can see the mountain in the distance and are deciding which path we should take to get there. 

I?m not even close to saying I?m at the peak, and I?m not even sure that the peak is possible to get to. However, I know the climb itself is one of our greatest metaphors for human growth. 

On my way up my proverbial mountain, I aimed to read and apply the knowledge of at least 100 self-help books. Once I did this, I decided it was a time to turn it into a guidebook for mountaineers of life. 

All these authors helped me live a better life, and now I feel in a position to help others as best as possible. Therefore, in short, this book is a summary of the techniques I applied that resonated with me most. 

I?ve structured this book to revolve around three key principles: Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose


* Autonomy is predominantly about getting your life under your control. Although I?m helping give you tools for your mountain summit, it?s up to you to work your physical, mental, and emotional body/mind. 
* Mastery is about choosing what you want to learn in life and continuous improvement to become the best you can possibly be. Know that the early stages of mastery is foolery. Although experts seem so natural at something, they all had to start somewhere. You?re at the foot of the mountain of any pursuit before can start your ascent.
* Purpose is about fulfilment. Once you master something, you can use your skills to help others. The result of this is a greater sense of satisfaction in your life.

I have a few strengths. I have a good understanding of history, psychology, economics, and technology. I use the past the understand the present and predict the future (This comes in handy with investing!). I use psychology to understand human motives, including my own. 

During my 31st year on this planet, I was fortunate enough to reach financial independence. Since 2012, my investments have averaged a 90% return year after year.

Success?or our personal view of the peak of the mountain?are subjective. My view of success is heavily influenced by evolutionary psychology. Understanding the evolution of humans is as helpful as trying to understand how we interact in today?s digital world?because everything is linked to what came before it.


Let?s go over some facts. The fossil record goes back 178m years. The average mammalian species lives a million years before evolving or going extinct.
 
We are 200,000 years old. So we?re pretty much an orphaned teenager. There isn't a parent civilization to guide us away from serious self-harm and perhaps even total destruction. 

We spent about 188,000 years as nomadic tribes. Evolution rewarded survival to those that learned something that helped the group. This gave birth to a ?tit-for-tat? system of communication that?s rife in our modern world even if we don?t recognize it. 

In our evolutionary past, if we shared some of our hunted food with another member of our tribe who didn?t have any, what did you think they were they were more likely to do when they had food and we didn?t have any? Share it. 

But the point is that it felt good to share in the first place, to not expect anything in return. But the likelihood went up.

This reinforced pro-social behavior over approximately 400 generations. Long story short, it feels good when we do charitable work, or buy a homeless person a meal. We?ve even devised belief systems like karma, which could be an evolutionary overhang from the tit-for-tat system.

However, when I don?t serve others, I?m far more likely to get anxiety or depression. If I only focus on myself to climb the mountain, I?m not getting very far at all. It?s essential to help others too.

Currently, humanity is going through a communications, transport, and energy revolution. Technological growth is compoundable. In the 4th century BC, humans invented the wheel. In a mere couple of thousand and a half years, we can now view the earth from the outside, communicate instantaneously across the planet, and get cooked food whenever we want by tapping on a glass screen from our modern-day caves (AKA, a house).

When communications, transport, and energy technologies converge, an industrial revolution happen. These revolutions cause our civilization to reorganize.

The future is a place of accelerated change. The internet will continue to expand into new industrial sectors (communications), cars will drive themselves (transport), and we?ll transition to a distributed green energy network (energy). 

Humanity?technologically-speaking at least?will continue to advance despite depleted resources, dying economies, and climate change. 

But it?s not all doom and gloom. After all, those are opportunities for us to grow as a species, and to ascend the mountain of positive change. 

Here?s what I think: It?s time for humanity to stop shitting where we eat. Responsibility comes before freedom. So let?s start eating our vegetables rather than glutting ourselves to death on ice cream. 

I wrote this book to uplift as many people as possible so we can navigate this change together. 
Don?t get me wrong, I?m tremendously optimistic about our future. The extrinsic threat of climate change is a golden opportunity for humanity. Because it?s something bigger than ourselves, we?ll unite behind our singular purpose and ourselves and the planet better. If you?re a pessimist, fine?but know that without hope we will be doomed. 


I wake up everyday with the Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose formula on my mind. I spring out of bed excited and go to bed with a deep sense of accomplishment. It?s my desire that you feel the same.

Let us begin this journey with the simplest and most essential steps: how to change your mindset so that you can get to the mountain and climb it to achieve the life you really want.

This book starts out with a brief look at history, and a more objective assessment of humanity and our ancestral environment(s). From here, we can understand the context of what skills we need to develop so we can thrive in the now and in our future environment.

It?s essential you start preparing for where you?re going to be now. Things are about to change so rapidly and not being ahead of the curve will be at your peril. 

So go get your climbing boots, tents, and food supplies. This book is going to help teach you how to climb the mountain of what?s to come.
