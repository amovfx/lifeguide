##Negotiation

Does the thought of having to negotiate a deal with someone cause you to feel nervous or tense? Do you dread it? Or is it something that you’ve mastered and look forward to? 

Many of us dread the negotiation process. Why? Because most of us don’t know how to negotiate anything well—and yet, it’s a fundamental component of life. 

Every interaction you have with a human being is a negotiation. Even the amount of time you give each other to speak or listen is a negotiating process. Why do most of us struggle to do it so much?

In his book, “Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as If Your Life Depended on It,” Chris Voss explains how to get what you want when you negotiate anything with anybody. 

Chris worked for the FBI as a hostage negotiator. He is an expert in negotiating situations that have lives on the line, so he knows a thing or two about the subject.

At the heart of negotiation is emotional intelligence and effective listening. When you are a better listener or more empathetic, you can become a better negotiator. And when you are a better negotiator, it’s easier to reach your goals because you know how to get others to help you. Effective negotiating is being an effective listener while getting someone to give you what you want. 

Here are 7 key points from his book:

### 1) Use active listening 

Most of us don’t know how to listen. We listen for what we want to hear and filter out the rest. Not only that, but we tend to think more about what we are going to say next rather than really listen. Active listening when you really understand what the speaker is saying, and more importantly, feeling. When you active listen, you can say back to the speaker what they said but in different words to show you’ve understood it.

### 2) Be a mirror

Being a mirror to what the other person is saying is about repeating the last three words or the last three most important words from the other person. You can also repurpose what they’re saying and repeat it back to them to see if you have understood them properly. Also, mimicking their body language, tone of voice, and inflection helps you to connect and relate to them better. Feeling what someone else is feeling is called neural resonance. 

### 3) Don’t feel their pain; label it

Label what the other person feels when you think you know how they are feeling. But don’t tell them. Ask. And if you don’t want to ask, then use tentative statements that begin with: 

“It seems like….”
“It sounds like…”
“So is it true that…”

Then, if the other person accuses you of telling them how they feel, with these “tentative" statements, you can say, “Well, I didn’t say that you felt that way. What I said was that it seemed like you felt that way.” 

### 4) Beware of “Yes”—Master “No”

A “no” is better than an insincere “yes.” Aim to get the other person to say “no” so that you can operate from there. Getting the other person to say “no” gives them the power and a feeling of safety. Once they have said “no,” they are more likely to open up to you with the truth. 

### 5) Be the first to anchor

Anchoring means calling out the number first to which all other numbers will be compared. When you anchor the number first, you have the advantage. This is especially useful when negotiating financial transactions. 

### 6) Priming and Consistency Bias

When the other person makes an offer, use words like “generous” and “fair.” They will be more likely to subconsciously want to live up to those attributes.

### 7) Be willing to walk away

To negotiate effectively, you must be willing to walk away from the deal. Don’t be needy. Shake things up if the other person offers something that doesn’t work for you. Use “I” to bring the focus back to you.
