# Relationships

When we use the term “relationships,” we are including every type: romantic, friendship, work and career, neighbors, clients, customers and more. 

As stated earlier, relationships are arguably the most important aspect of life besides your health. Without them, life would feel meaningless. We all enjoy connecting with others on some level, whether that be finding the love of our life, or connecting with a new friend with whom we have something in common. 

Therefore, your purpose is intricately connected to your relationships. In almost every case, when a highly successful person has “made it” in life, what they want to do later is to give back to humanity and the community that supported them in their endeavors. There’s a term for this: philanthropy. 

No one gets to where they are by themselves. To pay it forward, the ultimate desire/goal is to be of service to others. This desire is almost universal once a person has “made it to the top.”

One of the keys to success in life and fulfilling your purpose starts with mastering your relationships. It is the most valuable, productive thing you will ever do. 

One of the best books on relationships is “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie. According to Wikipedia, “Over 30 million copies sold worldwide, making it one of the best-selling books of all time.” 

In the description for the original book, it promises twelve things that the book will do for you:


### What it does

 * Get you out of a mental rut, give you new thoughts, new visions, new ambitions.
 * Enable you to make friends easier.
 * Increase your popularity.
 * Help you to win people to your way of thinking.
 * Increase your influence, your prestige, your ability to get things done.
 * Enable you to win new clients and customers.
 * Increase your earning power.
 * Make you a better salesman, a better executive.
 * Help you to handle complaints, avoid arguments, and keep your human contacts smooth and pleasant.
 * Make you a better speaker, a more entertaining conversationalist.
 * Make the principles of psychology easy for you to apply in your daily contacts.
 * Help you to arouse enthusiasm among your associates.


### What you need to do
 * In this book, there are three fundamental techniques in handling people. They are:
Don’t complain, condemn, or criticize because you will never get the result that you desire.
 * Give sincere and honest appreciation to others. People can tell when you don’t mean what you say. Remember, you cannot 
_NOT_ communicate.
 * Your appreciation must be heartfelt, sincere, and meaningful. Appreciating others is a powerful tool. Also, people cannot 
do their best while they are being criticized so it never works anyway.
 * See things from the point of view of others and inspire them through their eyes. Forget your own perspective but combine what you want with what they want so that they will be eager to work with you. 

In addition, the book has a section about “Six Ways to Make People Like You.” They are: 

 * 1) Become genuinely interested in others.
 * 2) Smile. Smiling makes others feel great, and it works for you too.
 * 3) Remember people’s names. A person’s name, to that person, is the most important word in all languages. Try to memorize people’s names and use them. It’ll help you in every social situation (including negotiations).
 * 4) Be a good listener. We’ve already discussed this. Many times, people want a good listener and don’t want the entertainment of your side of the conversation. You must care about what other people have to say to be a good listener. One tip I learned is to work out (or ask) if someone is on the communications channel or solutions channel. Sometimes people want to discuss something without advice, and sometimes people want advice. Work out which one is which. 
 * 5) Talk to others about their interests. Take a genuine interest in their them. That’s how to make it into their heart. It makes them feel valued and you get to learn something new. Everybody wins. 
 * 6) Make the others feel important—and do it genuinely. Allow them to talk about themselves. Treat others the way you want to be treated. (Also, treat yourself like you’d treat your best friend, pet, or partner—with high value, dignity, caring, and respect.)

There are many other words of wisdom from the book such as avoid arguing because even if we win, we still lose. Don’t ever flat-out tell someone that they are wrong because it will insult their pride and offend them. 
If you are wrong, admit it emphatically and quickly. Be friendly from the start, even if you feel upset. There’s no need to let your ego get in the way.

Start with questions where the person will answer “yes,” and talk about things that you agree on, not the things you don’t. Let the other person do most of the talking. Try to see things from their perspective. Be sympathetic with their needs, ideas, and desires. 

Many famous people such as Warren Buffet swear by this book. It’s a great tool to better yourself and your relationships.
