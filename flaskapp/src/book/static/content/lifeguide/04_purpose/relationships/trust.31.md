# Trust

The Webster dictionary describes trust as the “assured reliance on the character, ability, strength, or truth of someone or something.” Trust is  the confidence you have in someone. It’s one of the most essential qualities that you or any entity—such as a business—can have. 

Without trust, a business will collapse over time. And if others don’t trust you, your life will suffer in almost every manner.

The author Stephen M. Covey (the son of Stephen R. Covey) wrote a great book titled, “The Speed of Trust.” In his book, he explains how trust has a direct impact on the economics of any business, and individuals, too. So, it’s essential you cultivate trust in yourself first. In other words, if you say you’re going to do something, even if it is only for you, then do it. Consider your current commitments before you make new ones. 

Here are three lessons from The Speed of Trust:

Lesson 1: Trust increases speed and thus lowers costs in businesses.

When customers trust a business to deliver what they want in a timely fashion, they have trust in that company. For example, people trust FedEx to deliver packages overnight. FedEx is exceptional at keeping their word that they’ll deliver. The trust that customers have in them for speed increases the speed of customer decision-making. They don’t hesitate to decide which company to choose when their package “absolutely, positively has to be there overnight.” Trust increases speed. It speeds up interactions and lowers costs.

But by the same token, not having trust can have the opposite effect. Think about what happened at every airport after 9/11. It used to only take half an hour to go through security, and now it takes about one and a half hours. Trust speeds up transactions. Lack of trust slows it way down. 

Lesson 2: You must first trust yourself; trust is similar to confidence.

Trust must start with yourself. If you don’t believe in yourself, then how do you expect others to? So, build trust in yourself. Keep your word to yourself. If you commit to doing something, do it. If you are over-committed on things, you have a problem, and you’re jeopardizing your trust. For example, if you commit to working out 3 times a week, then do it. When you do what you set out to do, you will build greater trust with yourself and lead a better life.

Lesson 3: For business, try to develop societal trust through contribution.

According to Covey, for a business, three groups can apply trust: the customers, the employees, and society. The Rodney King LA riots in 1992 highlighted that not a single McDonald's was ransacked or destroyed. At the time, society deemed McDonald’s trustworthy. McDonald’s had a history of giving free cups of coffee to the homeless, had literacy programs, jobs for the less privileged, and gave basketballs to teenagers so they could shoot hoops in their community. 

Everyone has access to the universal asset of trust. Conducting yourself in a way that promotes trust will flourish in all your relationships—personal and business alike. Trust is an investment that pays serious dividends.

Trust is one of the most powerful forms of motivation and inspiration. Trust is what people want. They respond to trust and thrive on it. Therefore, cultivating self-trust is critical. Do what you write down.
Covey says that, to develop great trust in yourself, you must have the four cores. They are:

#### 1) Integrity

Integrity is about keeping your word and being honest with both yourself and others. It’s also about admitting when you get lucky and being humble in how you portray yourself. We tend to underestimate our own failures and overestimate our achievements. Take responsibility and try to be objective.  

#### 2) Intent 

Intent is about not having ulterior motives but having admirable ones instead. It’s about putting meaningful work above becoming rich. It’s about having positive pro-social motives and behavior.

#### 3) Capabilities

Capabilities are about being competent at what you do and being the kind of person who wants to develop and learn new skills even though you don’t have to. Not only will you be more confident, but others will feel more confident in you, too. 

#### 4) Results

Results are about building a track-record of deeds that you completed and were committed to. 


###Digressions

Trust takes a long time to build and an instant to destroy, but if you lose trust, you can repair it. When you do make a mistake, take responsibility, and make a strong effort to repair the trust.

A good idea is to over-repair. Go the distance to communicate how important a trusting relationship is to you.
