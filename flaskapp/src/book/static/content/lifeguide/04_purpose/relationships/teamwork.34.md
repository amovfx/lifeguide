# Teamwork

Being able to work well with others on a team is a valuable ability to have. It’s one of the top things a 
company looks for in an employee. But it’s also a desire for employees who understand that working with a good, 
strong team reaps many rewards. 
The Deloitte Millennial Survey of 2016 showed that for millennials, working with a strong team where there is 
active encouragement of ideas amongst employees, free-flowing communication, mutual support, respect, and 
tolerance would be enough to make them want to stay on the job. 
Here are the crucial elements to building a productive team:
 * Communication: This is the most important aspect of teamwork. All team members must be updated on the progress 
   of the project.
 * Ideas: A team must feel comfortable with one another to brainstorm effectively to solve problems. 
   A trusting and respectful team environment can help foster creative ideas.
   The best brainstorming ideas come from high-functioning teams.
 * Support:Members are glad to share information and knowledge that they have with others, and it creates a synergistic 
   effect. Team members are happy to help one another, and a spirit of comradery and connection is created. The result is high productivity from the team and high satisfaction from 
   the members.

Google conducted a two year study to find out the key attributes that make the best performing teams. 

 * Psychological saftey. People need to be able to take risks without feeling insecure or embarassed.
 * Dependability. Delivering high-quality work on time.
 * Structure and clarity. People need to understand their goals, roles and execution plans.
 * Meaning of work. The purpose of the work is important to everyone on the team.
 * Impact of work. Making a positive difference on the lives of others is what gives us meaning.

   
We are social creatures. When we first started out, we were nomadic tribes of around 150 people.
We've been working in close knit teams to ensure our survival for the first 188 000 years of our existence. We've been 
an agrarian society for 12 00 years, and a fully connected civilization for less than 50.
We have 188 000 years of evolutionary pressure on our brains telling us how to cooperate. We are stronger together.
It's just our natural state.
