# Social Skills

Remember, relationships are one of the top key aspects of your life. We don’t just need others to survive—we desire to make deep, long-lasting, and meaningful relationships with our family, friends, and even in our 
professional lives. Having good social skills will help you create the best relationships you can. 

### What can you do? 

Smile more. It may seem like such a no-brainer, but just giving someone a friendly smile lifts your mood and theirs too. When you smile, you tell yourself and others that all is well in your world, that you’re a 
happy, trustworthy, and approachable person. When you smile, the whole world will smile with you (and when you frown, the world will reflect that back to you). 

In short, you get what you give. Remember that as you go about your life. Oh, and don’t forget manners. Saying please and thank you costs nothing!

Another thing that you can do to hone your social skills is to pay attention to how you listen. The basics are, listen and don’t interrupt someone when they’re talking to you. Seek to understand, then to be understood. Listening is the most valuable skill you’ll ever develop. Cultivate the skill of listening. 

Develop opening your ears and hearing what the other person has to say—doing so will legitimise their existence. Then, work on developing your empathic listening.  

Empathic listening is the ability to put yourself into the shoes of another person and to empathize with how they feel. It allows you to better understand the person that’s talking to you.

Furthermore, empathic listening highlights the fact that the words that come out of a person’s mouth may not match the delivery. For example, a mother who is mad at her child may yell, “Don’t you know that I love you?!” The child knows instantly that the words coming out of the mother’s mouth don’t match the emotion or feeling behind them. 

When the feeling matches the words, it’s a successful delivery of the message or transaction. When they don’t match, it’s not. Be aware of conflicting messages from people. Read between the lines. Understand your gut reactions to see how trustworthy they are. 

In the example with the mother, it’s a very apparent “failure to communicate.” But there are many more subtle things to look out for. If someone, like your boss, employee, or co-worker is stressed out, you can tell in by the delivery of their message. Pay close attention and alter your behaviour accordingly. 

Listen to the tone of whoever is talking to you, and you’ll understand a lot more about what they’re saying compared to just listening to their words. This also means you should be aware of your own tone. Being self-confident and assured is essential if you want to communicate your message or negotiate well. There’s a huge difference between, for example:

“I think I’m the best person for this because I’ve been very successful before. I will do my best?”

And

“You’ve nothing to worry about. I’ll handle this job.”


Another way to improve your social skills is take a genuine interest in other people’s interests and understand why they like what they do, even if it’s something that isn’t your primary area of interest. Develop a type of child-like curiosity about others, know that they know something you don’t, and they could let you know something valuable.

This also works in dating. If you’re on a date, the more questions you ask, the better. We all want to talk about ourselves, so give others the chance to talk about themselves. People will like you more. Your date will have a better chance of being successful. 

Another piece of advice I have for you is to never criticize anyone publicly. Others will fear that you may do the same thing to them in the future and will want to avoid you. And don’t criticize anyone through email either. We tend to unleash our wrath more readily and easily through emails and texts because there is no immediate response to deal with. Also, it’s easier for the tone of our written communication to be lost. Always be careful with how you word something. A poorly written email or text is the quickest and easiest way to ruin a relationship. 

Instead, be lavish and generous with your praise. Look for the good in others and the good is what you’ll see. Admit your own mistakes openly. Don’t make excuses. Don’t blame others. Take responsibility. Call attention to other people’s mistakes indirectly but only in a way that can help others improve. Be kind, brave, honest, and devoted to your beliefs. Surround yourself with good people. 

Life’s joys are in becoming a more loving, humble person—not in gaining material possessions or climbing the social status ladder. 

##Dealing with Assholes

When you master something and become a leading expert, you’ll lose all the benefits of all your effort if you aren’t humble about your achievements. You need to work with people to accomplish tasks that are bigger than what you can do by yourself. People don’t want to work with someone self-centred, braggadocios, and selfish. 

Although it’s a bit of a contentious term, ‘asshole’ is the right term for all those people who bully or put down other for their own gain. As you ascend the mountain, you should be helping others up, not pulling them down.

There are several reasons why it is important to steer clear of assholes… 

Assholes are bad for business. No one wants to take orders from, or work with, an asshole. Their attitude ripples outwards. It’s even worse when you get an asshole in management, because of the extra power they have over people.

The negativity that they create around them can permeate an entire company, grow like cancer, and eventually destroy the company culture and even the company itself.

An asshole-free environment creates a great working environment. Fewer assholes means more equality for the team, and everyone can have their say. Assholes can be controlling, which limits creativity, leading to poorer results. 

Multiple studies show that giving people higher social status enables asshole behavior. Therefore, there’s a tendency for anyone who advances to management levels to become more of an asshole. 

There is an inverse correlation between being an asshole and being a good manager or leader. In other words, the better a manager is, the less of an asshole they tend to be…

Managers set the tone and the company’s cultural attitude by how they treat others and how they act while under stress. Therefore, managers must foster an attitude of cooperation amongst employees instead of competition. 

The human moral compass is highly malleable to the moral compass of the group. A good leader is going to bring out the best in a group. A bad one brings out the worst.

Do all you can to avoid assholes in your life or else you run the risk of their negativity and attitudes rubbing off on you. In other words, avoid assholes lest you become one. Make sure you surround yourself with the best, positive people who’ll lift you up as you lift them up. Assholes are in it just for themselves. Good people are in it for you and them. They’ll appreciate reciprocity. Be a good person. 

### But what if you don’t have a choice? 

Build emotional distance between any asshole you encounter and yourself. In other words, deal with them on only a purely necessary level and don’t invite them into your life in any way, shape, or form. A good phrase is to “be careful who you invite into your house.” And I don’t just mean where you live, but also your mind. The more you let an asshole in, the worse the outcome for you will be.

You need to purge assholes from your life (ha!), because negative actions have five times the effect on you over positive ones.

Champion a no-asshole policy wherever you go. If you are in a leadership position and have a high performing asshole, write them a stellar letter of recommendation and ship them to the competition. Or call a head-hunter and tell them to headhunt them for you. Find them a job away from you. Trust me, things will get better once you get rid of this person.

If you are an asshole, change your behaviour. Learn how to be a better person. See people as collaborators, not just useful to achieve your own means. Be nice to people and listen. Know that everyone you interact with knows something you don’t, so humble yourself.
