In Autonomy, we covered how to analyze yourself so you could have a more rounded idea of who you are. We learned that, through analysis, you learn what you need to develop. We covered the autonomous mindset and how to develop it to fend off manipulation and begin to take control of your life. You now have a baseline understanding of where you are right now. 

In Mastery, we’ll discuss the tools we need to build ourselves up to achieve the life we want.

In this part, we’ll prioritize our health, relationships, and career. We’ll examine the tools we need to build us a strong foundation so we can thrive.

PART 2: Mastery

Remember: before we master our environment, we must master our interior. Think of your interior like a game—you need to hone your skills and build your attributes as much as possible. 

This part will cover all the things you need to thrive in the world: health, habits, focus, fears, failure, time, goals, and finances. 

Once you begin to master these components, you’ll be well on your way to mastering your life. 

So, here’s the rule of thumb—if you choose not to invest the time, you’ll fail to achieve your goals. Invest in yourself now and you’ll reap the rewards for the rest of your life. You get what you focus on.

Health is the most important aspect of our lives. If our health deteriorates, nothing else matters. To maintain good health, it’s essential we exercise, get plenty of sleep, and eat mindfully. 

Think of it as a virtuous feedback loop. For example, when you exercise, you’ll more likely crave healthy foods. You’ll also be more tired, which can help you sleep better.

Therefore, take a holistic approach to health. The more you work in in each area, the more the others will benefit. 

By staying in good shape now, we can spend more time with your loved ones and avoid costly medical bills in the future. Think of good health like a financial decision, akin to investing. The more you invest in your health, the more you’ll get closer to mastery.
