# Time management


### The Most Precious Resource

Our most important resource is your time. We can't buy it back, and we don't know how much each of us has.
A very good tip I recommend you do is really put a price tag on 
your time. Write it down and put it somewhere you can see it regularly. Even if that means placing them in multiple spots.
Once this is done, you will have a reminder to gauge if what you are doing is worth that amount.

We want to make sure we use this very limited resource wisely and invest it accordingly. What this book is about is turning your time
into skill, so you can turn those skills into more free time. To reach a world-class level in a discipline takes about
10 000 hours of focused practice. I think everyone would agree, the sooner we do that, the better.

### The ABCDE Method

The GTD Method is great for getting tasks done, but it doesn't prioritize them. This is why we need the ABCDE 
method. It prioritizes we tasks. 
The idea comes from the book “Eat that Frog!” by Brian Tracy. Mark Twain came up with that catchy phrase to mean 
that if you ate a frog first thing in the morning, everything you did after that point would be easy. 
Productivity gurus like Brian Tracy used this idea to apply it to tasks. 
In other words, start your day with your most urgent, difficult task first. When you complete that one, do 
the next one that is the most urgent or highest priority. But there is a difference between urgent and important. 
Start with the most urgent tasks that you must do, but also, make sure to work on your most important yet NOT 
urgent tasks. This concept was taught by another productivity guru Stephen Covey. In other words, some things 
are urgent but not important, and some things are not urgent, but important. You need to focus more on the “not 
urgent, but important” tasks and give them the daily attention that they need. An example would be, writing your 
book or learning a new skill or learning how to make money online or learning a new language, etc.  
The premise of the ABCDE method is easy. “A” tasks are the highest priority, followed by “B,” then “C.” “D” 
stands for “Delegate,” and “E” stands for “Eliminate.” Here is a more detailed description:
<ul>
    <li>"A" tasks: Must do tasks that have major consequences if not completed.</li>
    <li>“B” tasks: Should do tasks with mild consequences if not completed.</li>
    <li>“C” tasks: Least important, nice to do tasks with no consequences.</li>
</ul>

 Within the “A” tasks, you can prioritize them using numbers starting with 1 being the top priority. So, 
“A1” would be the highest priority. “A2” would be next and slightly lower priority than “A1,” and so on. 
Then you do the same thing for the “B” tasks. “B1,” “B2,” “B3,” etc. 

Delegate (D) tasks to others to free yourself for your “A” tasks and Eliminate (E) any task that you can 
for the same reason – to free yourself up for those important “A” tasks. 
If you are doing something that isn't moving towards your goal, you have to stop. You need to recognize 
distractions for what they are. Distractions can cause you dearly in the long run, but with the GTD and 
ABCDE methods, you can easily know what task you should work on next. 

### Eisenhower Matrix

This is another useful tool. As your tasks come in, put them into there respective quadrants. The simple rule of thumb for this
is do not let things get into the "Do First" area. You dont want things getting into the category of important and urgent. 
That is going to cause immediate stress.
