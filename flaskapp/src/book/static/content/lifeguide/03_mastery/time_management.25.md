### The Most Precious Resource

As previously mentioned, our most important resource is your time. We can't buy it back, and we don't know how much of it we have. One thing we do know is that none of us have very much time at all. 

I recommend you put a price tag on your time. Write it down and put it somewhere you can see it regularly. Even if that means placing this tag in multiple spots. Once you’ve done this, you’ll have a reminder to gauge if what you are doing is worth that amount.

We want to make sure we use this very limited resource wisely and invest it accordingly. This book is about is turning your time into skills, so you can turn those skills into more free time. To reach a world-class level in a discipline takes about 10,000 hours of focused practice. The sooner we start practicing, the better.

### The ABCDE Method

The ABCDE method prioritizes our tasks. 

The idea comes from the book “Eat that Frog!” by Brian Tracy. But novelist Mark Twain came up with that catchy phrase to mean that if you ate a frog first thing in the morning, everything you did after that point would be easy. 

Productivity gurus like Brian Tracy used this idea to apply it to tasks. 
To apply it, you should start your day with your most urgent, difficult task first. When you complete that one, do the next one that is the most urgent or highest priority. 

However, understand that there’s a difference between urgent and important. 

Some things are urgent but not important, and some things are not urgent, but important. It’s essential to discern between the two. [ANDREW: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO? PLEASE EXPLAIN] Once you’ve done this, start with your most urgent tasks, then make work on your most important yet NOT urgent tasks. 

You need to focus more on the “not urgent, but important” tasks and give them the daily attention that they need. An example of these types of tasks would be writing your book, learning a new skill, learning how to make money online, or learning a new language. Anything that’s going to improve your life quality can fit into this category.  

The premise of the ABCDE method is easy. “A” tasks are the highest priority, followed by “B,” then “C.” “D” stands for “Delegate,” and “E” stands for “Eliminate.” Here is a more detailed description:

<ul>
    <li>"A" tasks: Must do tasks that have major consequences if not completed.</li>
    <li>“B” tasks: Should do tasks with mild consequences if not completed.</li>
    <li>“C” tasks: Least important, nice to do tasks with no consequences.</li>
</ul>

Within the “A” tasks, you can prioritize them using numbers starting with 1 being the top priority. So, “A1” would be the highest priority. “A2” would be next and slightly lower priority, and so on. Then you do the same thing for the “B” tasks. “B1,” “B2,” “B3,” etc. 

Delegate (D) tasks to others to free yourself for your “A” tasks and Eliminate (E) any task that you can for the same reason—to free yourself up for those important “A” tasks. 

If you are doing something that isn't moving you towards your goal, stop! You need to recognize distractions for what they are unhelpful. Distractions can cost you dearly in the long run, but with the ABCDE method, you can easily know what task you should work on next. 

### Eisenhower Matrix

The Eisenhower Matrix is another useful tool. As your tasks come in, put them into their respective quadrants. The simple rule of thumb for this
is do not let things get into the "Do First" area. You don’t want things getting into the category of important and urgent. 

That is going to cause immediate and unnecessary stress.

So, make sure you prioritise tasks properly. Value your time and plan it out adequately.
