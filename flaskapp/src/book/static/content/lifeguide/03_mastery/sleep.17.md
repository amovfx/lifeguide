# Sleep

We need good sleep to perform at our highest capacity. Sleep deprivation deprives the brain’s glucose content. This starves the areas for problem-solving and high-level thinking.

The following are sleep tips:

 * Get sunlight between 6 am and 8 am. This triggers a wake-up call to your brain, other organs, and glands.
 * Sleep in pitch black. Light at night suppresses melatonin by up to 50%. Turn all screens (TV, cell phone, computer screen) off 1 hour before bed.
 * Timing; go to bed at the same time within 30 minutes every night. This regulates our internal bio-clock. 
 * Do not work in the bedroom.
 * Get up early, we evolved to be active during the day.
 * 10 pm and 2 pm is when we have our peak production from melatonin and other hormones peak.
 * Caffeine has a half-life of 8 hours. You need to flush it before you can rest.
 * Alcohol prevents entering REM, the stage responsible for memory processing. Cut or limit your alcohol intake. 
 * Magnesium optimizes blood pressure, relaxes muscles, balances blood sugar levels, calms the nervous system, and is responsible for 300 biochemical reactions in your body. 
 * Meditate.
 * Make where you sleep a sanctuary of peace. No lights or distractions. English Ivy is the best air-filtering plant. “Mother in Law’s tongue” converts Co2 to oxygen at night.
 * Seek out professionals over doing your own research and succumbing to confirmation bias.
