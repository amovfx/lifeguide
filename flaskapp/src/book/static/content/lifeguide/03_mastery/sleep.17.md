# Sleep

We need good sleep to perform at our highest capacity. Sleep deprivation deprives the brain’s glucose content. This starves the areas for problem-solving and high-level thinking.

Lac of sleep is at pandemic levels, and it’s especially bad in the US. One survey found that the average night sleep in the US was under six hours in 2019. Considering we all need an average of eight hours of sleep a night, this is alarming.

A lack of sleep is dangerous. Those who are sleep deprived are more likely to get into car accidents, get injured playing sports, perform work tasks at lower levels, eat more unhealthily, be more like to suffer from anxiety and depression, and it contributes to aging as it can shorten telomeres. 

Here are some sleep tips so you can benefit from nature’s superpower:

 * Get sunlight between 6 am and 8 am. This triggers a wake-up call to your brain, other organs, and glands.
 * Sleep in pitch black. Light at night suppresses melatonin by up to 50%. Turn all screens (TV, cell phone, computer screen) off 2 hours before bed.
 * Go to bed at the same time within 30 minutes every night. This regulates our internal bio-clock. 
 * Do not work in the bedroom or look at your phone or watch TV in bed.
 * Get up early—we evolved to be active during the day.
 * 10 pm and 2 pm is when we have our peak production from melatonin and other hormones peak.
 * Caffeine has a half-life of 8 hours. You need to flush it before you can rest. Therefore, if you want caffeine, only have it in the morning.
 * Alcohol and marijuana prevent you from entering REM sleep, the stage responsible for memory processing. Cut or limit your alcohol and marijuana intake. 
 * Magnesium optimizes blood pressure, relaxes muscles, balances blood sugar levels, calms the nervous system, and is responsible for 300 biochemical reactions in your body. Consider a supplement, but always speak to your doctor first. 
 * Meditate.
 * Make where you sleep a sanctuary of peace. No lights or distractions. English Ivy is the best air-filtering plant. “Mother in Law’s tongue” converts Co2 to oxygen at night.
 * Seek out professionals over doing your own research and succumbing to confirmation bias.
