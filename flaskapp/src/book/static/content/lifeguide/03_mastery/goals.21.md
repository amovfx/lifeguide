# Goals

Although time mastery and goal mastery are very similar, we’ll focus purely on goal setting in this chapter.

Goal mastery and management are best accomplished by categorizing goals into levels. Let’s compartmentalize these.

- Level 1 Tasks: Current projects and tasks.
- Level 2 Tasks: Accountabilities, personal growth, health, finances, socialization, family, and planning. 
- Level 3 Tasks: Yearly goals.
- Level 4 Tasks: A long-term vision such as where you want to be in 3 to 5 years, and career aspirations. 
- Level 5 Tasks: Life’s purpose (what do you live for?).

### How to Create Goals

To create a goal, establish a vision of the end goal before you begin. Then, write it down. Make sure your goal is specific, rather than general. For example, the goal of “Write my book” is too general, and not an easily achievable bitesize aim. If you change it to “Write 500 words every day,” or “write for one hour every day,” then you’ve got something specific. 

Next, write down a list of everything you could do to achieve your goal. Include obstacles and a list of skills and knowledge you’ll need to achieve it. 

Then, set a date by which you think you can complete your goal. Be realistic. If the task is too large, break it down into milestones with sub-deadlines.

In our example of writing your book, let’s say that your obstacle was that you don’t have the peace, quiet, and time you need to write your book. The solution may be to write down a sub-goal of getting up half an hour early every morning so you can write 500 words every day. 

And, if you needed more knowledge to get your book published, in this example, then another goal would be to study how to self-publish your book, or how to write a book proposal to a traditional publisher.
 
Rank your most beneficial tasks and then add them to your calendar. The most important goals should be completed first. 

Start working on your tasks right away. Do something every day that helps you achieve your goals. At the very least, sit down and look at your tasks. This is the non-zero-day concept.

### Get into the Flow

Having a clear vision of your goals feels good. Use the GTD and ABCDE methods to organize and rank your goals, and then execute on them. When you discipline yourself enough to follow the systems described, you’ll activate your flow state. Flow is the same as “being in the zone.”

Once you build this into a habit, you’ll progress every day towards your dreams and goals. 

This is momentum.

The flow state can activate by challenging yourself at your knowledge boundary. Language and memory games can also trigger flow state.

To keep yourself motivated, tie your challenges to personal rewards. If you achieve a goal, reward yourself with something that you enjoy. Life is about living, never forget that—a suitable number of rewards will keep you happy!

Remember that the tasks that you choose to create shouldn’t be too difficult or too easy. It's a balance finding that knowledge boundary.
If it’s too difficult, ask for help. If it’s too easy, delegate it.
You need to be able to do your tasks with sustained effort. 

Turn your progress into a habit and you’ll have mastered goal setting.
