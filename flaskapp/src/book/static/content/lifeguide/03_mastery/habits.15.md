# Habits

Habits are the key to our success; they save us time and free up our brainpower to focus on longer-term goals. Once we implement good habits, we carry them out without too much conscious intervention. Know that the mind is always looking for shortcuts to processes and the more you build habits, the more intuitive these processes will be. 

Think about riding a bike. When you put enough practice in, you don’t need to think about cycling. There’s no need to think about how each leg pedals and what movements you need. It becomes ingrained as a habit, supported by muscle memory. 

We need to learn what habits are, how they work and how to build good ones into our daily routine. 

It’s essential that we identify bad habits and replace them with something better. Know that bad habits can't be stopped, they can only be replaced. 

This is the critical take-away.

Habits are the brain's optimization routine of a simple cue-routine-reward loop. A cue is a spike in your brain triggered from an 
external source. Our brains then decide which habit is appropriate for the situation. Routine is the activity you’re used to performing when faced with a particular cue. When completed, you get a spike in brain activity. 

That spill of electro-chemical goodness is what success feels like. The spike is the neurotransmitter dopamine, which reinforces the link between the cue and the routine. If you always go to bed at 9 PM, and you make it a habit, looking at the clock and seeing this time may make you sleepy. You will likely go to bed without thinking about it.

Habits are resilient. They live in the basal ganglia, a small neurological structure deep in the mid-brain. It can operate even when there’s brain damage in other areas of your brain. 

### Changing Habits

To change a bad habit, we must first believe that change is possible, and put our grit and focus to work. Once we recognize the cue or routine that accompanies our bad habit, then we can decide to replace it with something healthier.

Let’s say you eat chocolate every night. Once you finish dinner, your mouth waters for chocolate. Each time you eat chocolate, you give yourself the dopamine hit (as well as a caffeine and sugar hit), which makes you feel good momentarily. But you know in your heart of hearts that you shouldn’t eat chocolate every night. To change this habit, you could replace chocolate with peppermint tea. Now, each time you have the craving, put the kettle on, and make yourself a steaming cup of peppermint goodness. Replace the ritual. (Peppermint is also an appetite suppressant.)

In short: recognize the cue or routine (in the example, the cue is after dinner is eaten) and then choose the healthier replacement.

Keystone habits are small habits that stack up to have a larger impact on your life. We are the sum of our small, daily habits, and that’s why it’s so important to make sure we pick good ones.
 
University College London’s research shows that it takes an average of 66 days to form a habit. Therefore, it takes a lot of conscious willpower to spend that time forming a habit. However, once you overcome the conscious hurdle, you’ll start carrying out healthy habits unconsciously. 

The researchers also found a large deviation between the clinical trial participants. Some took only about 10 days to form a good habit, and some over 250 days. The point is that we shouldn’t aim for a certain number of days, but instead, commit to keep the good habit no matter how long it takes. Grit and patience will turn us into who we want to be.

Start by creating very small habits and build yourself up in layers of good habits. Remember we started of crawling before we could walk or run. If you try and create 10 new habits to replace old ones, chances are you’ll get overwhelmed. If you decide to quit drinking, start running at 6 AM every morning, stop watching television entirely, write for an hour every day in a journal, and quit smoking all at once, you are less likely to form the positive habits. Try tackling one or two things at a time. (Though, if you can do it all, go for it. I don’t want to discourage you, but just want you to make it easier for yourself.)

Make a list of habits you have that you want to change. Decide which of these you want to work on.


### The Power of Mini Habits

Don’t worry about progress—instead, make the goal to create the good habit first, and then work to improve the good habit. In the book “Mini Habits: Smaller Habits, Bigger Results,” Stephen Guise discusses this concept. He says that if we want to do push-ups every day, our goal should be to do one a day. The focus of the goal—in the beginning—is to create the good habit first. By setting your expectations super low, 
we’ll do the goal and develop the good habit. Then, before you know it, we’ll be “hooked” in a good way, and we'll be doing 10, 20, or 30+ push-ups every day. This idea of doing one push-up works well for 
when we don’t feel like doing push-ups at all, if we are sick, or don’t have the time. If our goal is only one, we’ll still be able to do it.

This is also called a no zero day policy. You must always do one. (Just a note: if you are doing press-ups (a “push” exercise), ensure you counterbalance it will a “pull” exercise (pull-ups, rows, etc.)—it’s essential you build the muscles in your back just as much as your chest, otherwise you’ll pull your posture out of whack. 

### Start Your Day Right

So many of us wake up and look at our phones first thing in the morning. This is because they tend to be charging next to our heads. You’re starting the day with a dopamine hijacker, looking at social media notifications and silly videos on YouTube—and this isn’t good. 

To mitigate this bad habit, put your phone in charge in another room, or at least out of your bedroom. When you wake up, it’s better to journal or just let your mind think about the dream you just had. Wake up more naturally. You’ll also likely get up quicker, and you’ll probably utilize your time better. 

How many of us get up without making our beds, only to sometimes go back to bed realizing that we never made it all day long? It’s a simple but effective habit, because you’re starting your day with cleanliness: you’re showing your subconscious mind that today is going to be clean and organized. 

Since it takes so little time to start, why don’t we get into the habit of making it right after getting up? It’s a great way to discipline ourselves to get into good habits, and it builds momentum for the rest 
of the day. 

Another way to develop good habits is to attach them to a current one you have. For example, if we already get on a stationary bike every day and we want to develop the good habit of reading a book every day, read that book at the same time (and leave your phone out of reach). Then, we can build up good habits in layers.

### Make the Habit Easy to Start

Another way to start a good habit is to work to reduce the “activation time.” Habit activation time means the amount of time it takes for us to start building our habit. It should be under 20 seconds.

Shawn Anchor, in his book, “The Happiness Advantage,” says that the less “activation time” that it takes you to start and complete your good habit, the better. Conversely, he says that the more activation time 
that it takes to start and complete your bad habit, the better for transforming it…

For example, Shawn wanted to get into the good habit of learning to play his guitar, but he found that he couldn't get himself to do it. What he realized was that the real problem was that he didn’t have quick 
and easy access to get to his guitar. He timed it and it took him an extra 20 seconds to get his guitar from its stored location and start playing. 

To solve the problem, he put his guitar in a strategic location with easy and quick access. When he did that, he was far more likely to develop that good habit. He also gave himself a visual cue—the guitar itself—to help him get in the swing of things. 

Basically, when you take away steps you need to take to your desired good habit, it becomes easier to implement. If you want to take up running every morning, layout your running clothes before you go to sleep the night before. Then, when you wake up, put them on straight away, even if you want to have coffee before you run. Because you’ve eliminated the steps of getting your clothes and putting them on, you’re far more likely going to step outside. Oh, and make sure your shoes are by the front door so you’re ready ASAP!

### Make the Bad Habit Hard to Start

Let’s look at Shawn’s again. Shawn wanted to stop the bad habit of watching too much TV. So, what he did was he took the batteries out of the TV remote and placed them in a location where it would take him more than 20 seconds of activation time to get to them. 

He would forget that he did this, pick up the remote, and try to turn the TV on (unconscious habit). When it didn’t turn on, because he knew it would take him time and energy to replace the batteries, he would not watch TV. Bad habit stopped! 

In other words, make it easy as possible to start good habits, and make it difficult to continue the bad ones… 

This is how we change our behavior.

One thing many of us do is look at our smartphones too much. Turning them off and placing them in a drawer can help our unconscious habit of looking at them all the time. Think about it.

What bad habits do you have? Write them down and find ways to replace them with good habits. 



### Habits aren't just for people

Groups such as corporations, societies, and cultures have good and bad habits as well. 

Habits of organizations can be dangerous but can change in times of crisis. Strong social group ties combined with peer pressure and new habits can start a movement.

Companies take advantage of habits in their marketing. Most people turn right as they enter department stores. Movements are born from strong ties, peer pressure, and new habits. 

Think of the multinational company, Amazon. They make it as easy as possible to get someone from seeing an item to buying it. The fewer steps to take (entering payment details, selecting options for shipping, filling out additional forms, etc.), the more likely someone will buy a product. 

**We bear the responsibility of changing our habits.**

This is what this book is about, teaching people like you to build good habits, so when you get together you can form good community and organizational habit. Then, those communities and organizations build good habits for our civilization. 

Be a part of the habit-transforming revolution! When you make better habits, you can then encourage others to do so as well.
