# Focus and discipline

Time is our most valuable resource. It’s so valuable that companies spend a lot of money to advertise as they’re competing for a precious resource—your attention. When companies have your attention, they have your time and, often, your money. 

Time is hard to come by because we live in a world of perpetual distraction, and we use social media sites and other apps that are remarkably successful at doing what they’re designed to do: addict us. 

Social media platforms are in the business of human futures. They sell to advertisers how likely we are to click an ad. They sell certainty. They sell us.

The ability to focus on building a better life for yourself is not in the best interest of some of the most profitable businesses ever built. It’s a serious problem that is essential to understand and overcome. Every service out there wants us to consume their content, not produce our own and compete with them.

One way to overcome this is to shift your mindset from a consumer to a creator. You’ll probably be happier drawing your own picture than buying someone else’s. It’s more rewarding to make a video yourself than watch a film.

One of the reasons we might watch films is because our own lives are devoid of the intrigue, drama, and entertainment. Films aren’t bad in and of themselves, but if we spend our whole lives passively watching television, we are not in a creator mindset. We’re living vicariously through constructed lives, which can be a detriment to our own.

### The Focus and Happiness Link

Research shows that your happiness is dependent upon focus. In the article “When the Mind Wanders, Happiness also Strays,” author John Tierney reports on research by Daniel Gilbert and Matthew Killingsworth. 

The New York Times summed up the research saying, “Whatever people were doing, whether it was having sex or reading or shopping, they tended to be happier if they focused on the activity instead of thinking about something else.”

The bottom line? 

Our happiness and our ability to achieve our goals is getting attacked by distractions… When we eliminate distracts, and focus on single tasks, we feel better. That means if we’re reading a book, we should turn the television off just to concentrate on the book.

### The High Cost of Distraction

In another important article in the New York Times entitled “Brain, Interrupted” by Bob Sullivan and Hugh Thompson, research at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University shows that the average office worker gets distracted every 3 minutes. Every 3 minutes!

But here’s the essential point they make…

It takes 25 minutes to regain focus after a distraction!

Therefore, getting distracted is so frustrating to those of us who experience it because of how much time it wastes. We know how detrimental it is to progress, but many others have a hard time understanding why. Now, we can tell them why! To be mentally present, we must avoid distractions. Turn off your phone notifications. Tell people not to bother you until a certain time. Find methods that work for you.

We must also cultivate our attention spans again. We’re used to everything being instant. The internet is now warp-speed. It used to take minutes to load up a page on a dial-up connection back in the early 2000s. We can order things online and sometimes get them delivered in four hours. Delayed gratification increasingly becoming a thing of the past. So, we’ve got to train our brains to be distracted less. 

### Why Distractions Win

Here’s the real problem according to the above-noted research… 
Distractions trigger our fight or flight response. We can’t help it. It is the natural reaction of our brains to danger. So, when you hear a loud, unfamiliar noise, our brains say something like, “This book we are writing on isn’t important right now! This loud noise could be dangerous!” 

It doesn't matter if the distraction is a noise or a co-worker/employee entering our cubicle/office with a question. A distraction is a distraction, and it will take you 25 minutes to get back on track. What a waste of productivity… 

The fight or flight response is programmed into us for our survival’s sake. There are times when this primal part of our brains could save our lives. If there was an explosion, or if you smelled smoke or heard a crash in the other room because your cat knocked over a pot of boiling water, it warrants your attention…

But most of the time, that system is hijacked by a loud “DING!” which tells us someone liked a photo of us duck-pouting in the mirror on social media. 

What else is important to know about our brains?

### Brain Focus Hacks

Our brains, when they’re in a regular schedule sleep pattern, handles difficult tasks best in the late morning, from about 10 AM to noon. After that, we are susceptible to distraction from noon to about 4 PM. So, schedule your toughest tasks for the day in the late morning time and take a break or just go for a walk in the afternoon if you can.

Write down the specific goal that you want to accomplish, preferably the night before, and then work on it in the morning. 

How can you enhance your ability to focus when your mind wanders? 

Some experts recommend that you first recognize when you’ve been distracted. Once you realize, focus on your breathing. Meditation is a great way to get more grounded so that you don’t get distracted so easily. 

Once you’re focusing on your breathing, let the train of thought that got you off track leave your thoughts by exhaling. Then, focus on your breath. Count the seconds. Four seconds in, four seconds hold, four seconds out, four seconds hold. Repeat.  

Exercising in the form of yoga is excellent for your focus, too. It helps you concentrate on every part of your body and breath. 

The first step to fighting distraction is awareness. Start monitoring how many times you get distracted in your day, and start to become aware of the scale of the problem. 

Some think that the goal should be to work eight hours straight without any interruption, but studies have shown that at around 20 to 25 minutes of straight work, most of us need a mental break. 

The need for a break gave rise to the new idea that it’s best to work for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. Of course, do what you think is best for you. Add or subtract the time limits to suit yourself best. 

You can even get apps that will help you stay focused. They can come in the form of timers and help hold your attention span accountable. However, the most important thing is to recognize when you’re distracted, followed by an action that’ll help mitigate the distraction like the breathing exercise we explored above. 

If a boss, co-worker, friend, or family member interrupts you too often, kindly explain to them to not disturb you unless necessary. You could even tell them that you work in 25-minute increments and ask them to not disturb you during that time, and that you’ll let them know when you’re free.
 
And if it is your email, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or any other social media app that’s the problem, take steps to limit your engagement with them. Set aside a specific time to use them and don’t let them interrupt you when you’re working on an important task. Learn to control your social media habits, rather than be controlled by them.

The good news is that the more that you work to master focus, the easier it will become. It’s like anything else—the more you exercise your focus 'muscle', the stronger it gets.
