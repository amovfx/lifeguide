# Exercise

Exercise promotes better sleep. Sleep promotes better energy and willpower. Diet, sleep, and exercise intertwine. When you build good exercise habits, you build virtuous feedback cycle and some serious momentum.

For me, exercise is the foundation of our habits. It replenishes our brain’s cerebrospinal fluid—a liquid that nourishes our neurons. Also, according to new research, exercise maintains our mental health as we age, and it reduces the chance of depression. When we exercise, we cause micro-tears in our muscles which triggers the release of testosterone and HGH which promotes healthy, rejuvenating sleep.

One of the best ways to get enough exercise is to choose something that we enjoy doing. There’s running, yoga, lifting weights, swimming, playing sport, walking…

If you want to exercise at home and create a habit of it, there are plenty of 30-day challenges on YouTube to get you started. You don’t need to spend any money—or even go outside—to get fit. Though it is good to see some sunshine and breathe in fresh air. 

Be sure to set goals and track your progress.
