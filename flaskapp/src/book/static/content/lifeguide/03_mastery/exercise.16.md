# Exercise

Exercise promotes better sleep. Sleep promotes better energy and willpower. Diet, sleep, and exercise intertwine. When you build good exercise habits, you build virtuous feedback cycle and gain some serious momentum.

Exercise is at the foundation of our good habits. It replenishes our brain’s cerebrospinal fluid—a liquid that nourishes our neurons and helps us perform better at mental tasks. 

Also, according to new research, exercise maintains our mental health as we age, and it reduces the chance of depression. When we exercise, we cause micro-tears in our muscles which triggers the release of testosterone and HGH which promotes healthy, rejuvenating sleep.

One of the best ways to get enough exercise is to choose something that we enjoy doing. There’s running, yoga, lifting weights, swimming, playing sport, walking… Just find what works for you. But do make sure you do a mix of aerobic and anaerobic exercise!

If you want to exercise at home and create a habit of it, there are plenty of 30-day challenges on YouTube to get you started. You don’t need to spend any money—or even go outside—to get fit. (Though it is good to feel some sunshine on your skin for vitamin D—although not too much so you burn—and breathe in fresh air.) 

Be sure to set goals and track your progress. Get exercising, get fitter, and enjoy the challenge!
