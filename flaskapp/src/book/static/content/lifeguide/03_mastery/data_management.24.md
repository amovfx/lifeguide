# Data Management

In today’s world we’re overloaded with emails, social media notifications, messages, video calls, and plenty of other things. These interrupt flow and makes us less productive. Anyone who says they can properly multitask are deceiving themselves. You cannot multitask, only engage in task-switching (some people just do this rapidly enough they think they’re multitasking). However, when you task switch, you run the risk of doing two or more things sub-optimally than if you just focused on one. 
 
Remember: we can only have so many things held in our mind at once. Ensuring we focus properly gives us more mental energy for the most demanding and creative work. Make it an aim to focus on single tasks. If you’re easily distracted, you should work on attention-optimizing exercises, like meditation. The more you train your attention muscle, the more it’ll grow. 

To maximize creativity, get all your ideas and plans out of your head and down on paper. Being aware of your job goals and current tasks will enable you to make good decisions about the work to come. These tactics help you prepare for difficulties and interruptions ahead of time.
Being well organized allows you to achieve more in less time.

This is a balancing act; you don't want to overdo it to the point it's keeping you from making progress on your creative ambitions.

To achieve your long-term goals, translate them into short term action steps. Once you get good at this, you can spread these ideas to your team to improve communication. Natural planning clarifies the goals and next concrete steps of your projects. 

Instead of dealing to-do lists, maintain a calendar and a next action lists. "Waiting for" lists can be very helpful when you work with other people. All ideas with potential future relevance should go to the someday lists, like learning languages, taking trips, ect.

For more of these tactics, let’s turn to David Allen, a productivity consultant.

###Tactics

Our brains are great at thinking about things, but terrible at remembering them. Therefore, we need the right workplaces, tools, and filing systems to optimize these things.

**Use lists.** 

Learn to love them if you don't already.

If you split time between work and home for your job, make sure your workspaces at work and home are identical. 

Capture your tasks, ideas, and reminders in trusted external collections tools that are digitized. Then, you can see everything you need to see at work or at home. If you write it down with pen and paper, it’ll get confusing. 

Clarify: empty all your external collection tools weekly. Purge your system once a year from your system becoming a bloated mess.

Organize: empty your collection tools and put things in the right place.

#### List-Fu
 
 * If something takes more than one action it is a project, and it goes on the ‘projects list.’
 * If something is a single action that you can delegate, it should go on a ‘waiting for’ list.
 * A single action that you defer it goes onto the calendar or onto a next action list.
 * A calendar is for time specific or date specific actions or information.
 * Next action lists are where all your to-dos end up. Split these lists up based on contexts.
 * If something is not actionable but you may need to do something about it, put it on the someday list.
 * Interesting information that’ll be useful later should go onto a reference material list.
 * Keep track of your current projects and always insist on clear next actions. Review these lists every week and make sure that each project has a clear and concrete next step.
 * Make your next actions as specific as possible.

#### Prioritizing

Reflecting on our systems is indispensable to productivity. Choose what to do in each moment based on the current situation priorities and energy level. 

Ask yourself the following questions.

 * What can I do in the current context?
 * What do I have time for?
 * What do I have energy for?
 * Which task is my highest priority?

Manage your data. Make lists. Live better.
