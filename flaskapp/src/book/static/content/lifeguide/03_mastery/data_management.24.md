# Data Management

Today's world overloads us with emails, social media, messages, Slack, Discord and Zoom calls. These interrupt flow and run risk context switching making us less productive. 
We can only have so many things on ours mind at once. Optimizing them gives us more mental energy for the most demanding creative work. We want Focus on the fewest possible things.

To maximize creativity, get all your ideas and plans out of your head and down on paper.
Being aware of your job goals and current tasks will enable you to make good decisions about the
work to come.
These tactics help you prepare for difficulties and interruptions ahead of time.
Being well organized allows you to achieve more in less time.

This is a balancing act, you don't want to over do it to the point it's keeping you
from making progress on your creative ambitions.

To reach your long term goals, translate them into short term action steps.
Once you get good at this, you can spread these ideas to your team to improve communication.
Natural planning clarifies the goals and next concrete steps of your projects. 
Instead of dealing to-do lists maintain a claendar and next action lists. "Waiting for" lists can be very helpful when 
you work with other people. All ideas with potential future relevance should go to the someday lists. Learn languages, take trips ect.

For more of these tactics we turn to David Allen.

###Tactics

Our brains are great at thinking but terrible at remembering things,
so we need the right workplaces, tools and filing systems. **Use lists.** Learn to love them if you don't already.
If you split time between work and home for your job, make sure your workspaces at work and at home are identical. 
Capture your tasks, ideas and reminders in trusted external collections tools.
Clarify: empty all your external collection tools weekly. Purge your system once a year from your system becoming a bloated mess.
Organize: empty your collection tools and put things in the right place.

#### List-Fu
 
 * If something takes more than one action it is a project. It goes on the projects list.
 * If it is a single action that you can delegate it should go on a waiting for list.
 * A single action that you defer it goes onto the calendar or onto a next action list.
 * Calendar is for time specific or date specific actions or information.
 * Next action lists are where all your to dos end up. Split these lists up based on contexts.
 * If something is not actionable but you may need to do something about it goes on the someday list.
 * Interesting information that will be useful later goes onto a reference material list.
 * Keep track of your current projects and always insist on clear next actions. Review these lists every week and make sure that each project has a clear concrete next step.
 * Make your next actions as specific as possible.

#### Prioritizing

Reflecting on our systems is indispensable to productivity. Choose what to do in each moment based on the current situation priorities and energy level. 
Ask yourself the following questions.
 * What can you do in the current context?
 * What do you have time for?
 * What do you have energy for?
 * Which task is the highest priority?
