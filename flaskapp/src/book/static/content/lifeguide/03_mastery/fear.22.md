# Fear and Failure

Fear is a powerful emotion that—under the right circumstances—can benefit us. For example, during a forest fire, you may need to run to safety. Having a fear of fire could give you a boost of energy to run fast enough to escape. When you feel fear, you brain dumps a lot of adrenaline and cortisol into your system to give you that extra boost of energy. 

Fear activates the evolutionary older parts of the brain, the lower limbic system. This system uses the nutrients from your blood which 
deprives your cerebral cortex of what it needs to function. It’s the same part of your brain where your critical thinking happens. 

Also, blood flow goes to your extremities to take physical action. Rational thought becomes difficult when you are in a state of fear or anger. I'm sure you can see how this is used in the mainstream media which pumps a steady stream of fear and outrage to dull our critical thinking.

For most of us, fear shows up in lots of other areas in our lives besides running from forest fires and dodging sabertoothed tigers. In many instances, fear is a hinderance to proper functioning. 

For example, most of us are fearful of public speaking. The problem is that our brain conflates running from a forest fire and public speaking, using the same tool to keep us “safe” from both. The former is a legitimate fear that can help us avoid death, and the other is an unfounded fear that stops us from growing. 

Although we have outgrown our evolutionary roots that got us to the modern day, our old systems still remain.

We can decide to move towards our fear, not away. And we can learn to use fear as a compass to drive our personal growth. 

### Unfounded Fear Roots

In every case of unfounded fear, there is an event from the past that caused it to take root. For example, if—when you were child—you had to give a speech in class, but you did poor and people laughed at you, the fear of public speaking may have rooted. 

Feeling shame, you convince yourself that you’re no good at speaking in front of people. A few years later, at another speech, you're ridiculed again, your neural pathways reenforce that you aren't good at it. 

After that event, if you did nothing to change that unfounded fear and belief that you’re not a good public speaker, when you get into adulthood, you’ll likely have the same fear of public speaking.

But the problem is that it was your childhood brain and mind that decided such an important thing. It wasn’t a rational, cognitive, and unbiased decision by your adult mind. For this reason, we should challenge all the negative beliefs and fears that we have from our adult mindset—not the childhood one. 

It’s essential you cultivate the necessary skills to face your fears.

### Mastering Failure

If you have an unfounded fear, ask yourself when you first got the fear. Challenge it. Talk to yourself in a logical way that sets your mind at ease relative to the fear. What you want to do is to reprogram your mind using logic and reasoning to calm its fears. 

Change can also ignite fear. So, if you are changing, you are going to need good fear management techniques so you can use your higher-level brain functions to shape your life into what you want.

### Make a Disaster Report

Face your fears immediately and put them into your own personal disaster report. This is a basic risk assessment concept that anyone can use. Here are the steps. Write each of them down:

- Clearly describe your fear.
- Determine your worst-case scenario. 
- Find a solution to the worst-case scenario.
- Do everything in your power to avoid the worst-case scenario.

### Failure as the Way

Failure is part of the journey to success. Failure is inevitable and is a critical part of moving forward.

However, failure also opens new opportunities. When one door closes, another one creaks open. 

Learning from failure is instrumental to success. What if Einstein had given up the instant that his first experiment failed? What if the Wright brothers gave up on the idea of flying when it first didn’t work? 

When you try something that doesn't work, now you know what doesn't work! You’re on your way to mastery. 

Overcoming the fear of failure to take new risks brings long-term success. It’s the fear of failure that gets to so many of us. That fear can stop us from accomplishing what it is we want to accomplish in life.

Failure is also a discovery of a competence and knowledge boundary. It will highlight for you what you need to work harder at. Failure will let you know when you need to know more or try a different method. And there’s nothing wrong with trying something new and failing at it. You’ve got to be the fool before you become the master.

Watch a baby trying to take their first steps. When they fall over, they don’t give up and stay crawling for the rest of their life. They try again and again until they master walking. 

How else are you going to learn? 

So much of it is about mindset. The fear of failure can keep you from many wonderful experiences. 

Don’t ever be afraid to try anything that you are even the least bit curious about. That is the joy of life. Try it, fail, and then try again until you get it. 

### Relabeling success

As we begin our life journey, we take on new and exciting challenges. Some that will be quite difficult. We will come to setbacks, we will break our commitments to ourselves, we will miss things on our schedules, but in the end, we will get back on track. Not for anyone else, but for ourselves.

That is what success really looks like: building your grit to push pass failures and disappointments. It isn't about the destination, it’s about the journey. So, buckle up and travel well!
