# Nutrition

Nutrition is such a huge topic and there are many different “experts” who think that they have all the answers. 

The problem is that everyone has a different body, and we each react to different types of nutrition. 

No one can tell you that they have the one-size-fits-all diet that’ll guarantee better health. Your body is different to my body. My body is different to my aunt’s. You know your body best. If you are seeking outside counsel, make sure that your nutrition advisor has a Bachelor of Science—or a higher qualification—in nutrition.

Nutrition is a science, not an opinion.

Nutrition drives sleep, energy levels, your immune system, and longevity. Here are some easy nutrition tips:

 * Eat whole foods.
 * Reduce the number of processed foods you consume, especially processed sugars like high-fructose corn syrup.
 * If it is junk food, ask yourself why you are putting junk into your body. Sure, it might taste nice, but it’s not helping you. It’s making you sick.
 * Get a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables. 

Understand your blood sugar and how the body stores fat to help make better choices. Low glycaemic foods regulate blood sugar better.

Your circadian rhythm primes your body to eat at certain times. We are primed to eat at certain parts of the day. For example, eating a huge meal before we go to sleep is a bad idea—it stops us from getting the sleep we need. Think of how uncomfortable it is!

Also, we become more resistant to insulin as the day goes on.

If you would like to make a change, start small and slowly like any other habit. Replace unhealthy foods with healthy foods. When you do this, you’ll notice an increase in your energy, strength, thought clarity, and motivation. 

Get out there and start eating healthily!
