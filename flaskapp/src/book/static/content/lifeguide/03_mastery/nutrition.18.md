# Nutrition

Nutrition is such a huge topic and there are many different “experts” who think that they have all the answers. Many of these “experts” push fad diets and falsities so they can sell their own supplements and courses, so be vigilant when it comes to nutrition. 

One of the difficulties in nutrition science is that everyone has a different body, and we each react differently to various types of nutrition. 

No one can tell you that they have the one-size-fits-all diet that’ll guarantee better health. Your body is different to my body. My body is different to my aunt’s. You know your body best. If you are seeking outside counsel, make sure that your nutrition advisor has a Bachelor of Science—or a higher qualification—in nutrition.

Nutrition is a science, not an opinion. If you find someone you like, look to see if they have education credentials. The below advice is from a Nutritionist with a Bachelor of Science.

Nutrition drives sleep, energy levels, your immune system, and longevity. Here are some easy nutrition tips that we can all follow:

 * Eat whole foods.
 * Reduce the number of processed foods you consume, especially processed sugars like high-fructose corn syrup.
 * If it’s junk food, ask yourself why you are putting junk into your body. Sure, it might taste nice, but it’s not helping you. It’s making you sick.
 * Get a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables. 

Understand your blood sugar and how the body stores fat to help make better choices. For example, low glycaemic foods regulate blood sugar better.

Your circadian rhythm primes your body to eat at certain times. We are primed to eat at certain parts of the day. For example, eating a huge meal before we go to sleep is a bad idea—it stops us from getting the sleep we need. 

Also, we become more resistant to insulin as the day goes on. Bear that in mind when you are making food choices. 

If you would like to make healthy changes to your dietary choices, start small and slowly like any other habit. Replace unhealthy foods with healthy foods. When you do this, you’ll notice an increase in your energy, strength, thought clarity, and motivation. 

Get out there and start eating healthily!
