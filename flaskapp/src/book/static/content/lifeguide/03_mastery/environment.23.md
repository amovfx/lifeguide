#Environment

As humans, we have the ability to reshape our environment to our will to a great degree. Although we have to obey physical laws, we can overcome the limitations of our bodies and minds with technology. We want to put this natural ability to work so we can reach our goals as quick as possible. The common term for this is Feng Shui.

We are products of our environment. So let’s build an environment that enables a virtuous cycle in our personal development. As we grow, we’ll reshape our environment to better suit our needs.

We have something called brain width (similar to “bandwidth”). In short, your brain can only focus on a limited amount of stimuli at any given time. By altering our environment, we can remove distractions and enhance our focus.

To be Feng Shui, look around your house and see if it’s in order. Set a designated place for every single object. When you organize yourself, you save precious time. Think about it, if everything is arranged and neat, you’ll find things easier, you’ll feel calmer because there’s less clutter, and you’ll not spend brain width thinking things like, “I must organize my office space.”

If you’d like to get better at organizing your space, whenever you enter a room, and you see something or many things out of place, put one or two things back where it belongs. If you see 50 things, you might overwhelm yourself with the size of the task. Make it bitesize and it’ll be easier for you. 

Organization can happen with our ideas. When you organize your ideas outside of your head to conserve mental energy. Think about it: If you have five meetings one day and you don’t write it down, you have to keep thinking about when they are. However, if you externalize this memory and keep a planner, you know that—upon a single glance—you’ll know exactly when your meetings are.

Therefore, make sure your computing and communications environment is organized as well. You want to have strong tools for managing your incoming communications and your outgoing communications. See your computer and your phones as extensions of yourself. Remember: There’s only so much you can store in your head, so you must write things down in places you’ll look. We’ll expand on this concept in the data management section.

Set aside time to refuel and organize your environment and you’ll benefit from the long-term time savings. Like everything here, this is just another positive habit you can build. Investing the time, a few times a week, pays dividends down the road. 

If possible, make your goals have a separate environment. If you like to play video games but work on the same machine, that is a risky and non-optimal combo, because when you walk in your office, you should use it for your projects only. My advice is that you make your entertainment area separate where you can relax and recharge.

This is similar to what we discussed in the sleep section about using your bed only for sleep (and time with your partner). If you use your phone in bed, or work on your computer, you’ll develop an association that isn’t sleep. If you use your office for game-playing, you’ll develop an association that isn’t work. 

Optimize your environment, and you’ll optimize your life.
