# Investment strategies

Indulge me for a minute, because I know a thing or two about investing.

I’ve had a 80% return year after year since 2012. For 2021, I'm up over 500%.

A word of caution, what worked in the past, doesn’t mean it will work in the present. 

The world is always changing and I’m using this book to share the skills to help people strategically position themselves in the future.


I formulate a strategy based off my knowledge of history, psychology, and technology. The internet has allowed us all to connect and cooperate in new ways that has brought significant disruption to major industries. If we look to history, this is hardly surprising. 

Whenever humans have developed a new way to record data, it has significantly impacted our civilization.

Let’s do a quick refresher on cuneiform, which we discussed previously.

The invention of writing, cuneiform, wasn't quite like the writing we know today. It couldn’t describe abstractions that would enable poetry or a novel. It was a script that enable contract law and most importantly ledgers.

This transformation enabled trade which led to humans living in highly sophisticated, interconnected, centralized hubs called cities. It allowed us to cross the nomadic civilization threshold into an agrarian one.

As history progressed, we developed new ways of storing and disseminating data. Language became more complex which allowed for religions to proliferate, as well as nation states.

The printing press, radio, tv, computers, databases, internet, blogs, and social media sites like Instagram and Facebook have all had monumental transformations upon our civilization.

Now we are at another the dawn of another transformation to our civilization. The computing and internet disrupted almost every industrial sector, but one industry remained undisturbed. Finance. The internet was missing a fundamental piece of the puzzle which would enable it to disrupt the finance and regulatory industries.

At first, it was impossible to send money through the internet without a trusted third party. If you wanted to send money, you had to use a bank. This is because banks are in control of a process called settlement. Settlement is the process that balances two separate ledgers. This maintains a stable monetary supply so the economy doesn't blow up.

However, this problem was solved by the invention of the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. It is the first time we are enabled to do settlement without a third party.

So, when we examine history, we can see a significant shift in how we organize when we discover a new way to record data.

### But what is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a network that enforces a distributed ledger. We have never had this and it was long thought to be impossible. There were numerous papers proving distributed consensus is impossible. Bitcoin changed this long-held believe.

Rather than being a true breakthrough in computer science—a bunch of computer security protocols put together—it’s an ingenious level of understanding and application of game theory. 

Therefore, when we look back at Bitcoin's history, we see that it has outperformed everything. It is the fastest asset to reach a 1 trillion valuation in history. Throughout 2010-2020, it had a return of 1.5 million percent.

The second prize would go to Netflix with a (comparatively) measly 4000% return. Bitcoin's performance is so good that their really isn't any reason to invest in anything else.

So, lets discuss the risks. There are tonnes of alt coins out there. How do we screen for these? Investing in this space is rife with scams, so it’s essential to look closely for a couple of properties.

The first property is open source. If you can’t see what a crypto is doing under the hood, it’s got a high probability of a security vulnerability at best, and a scam at worst.

Next, we look at the amount and quality of volunteers on the project. The activity of commits to the software should be visible. We need to see what the kind of talent that the project attracts.

Is this worth a world class engineer’s free time? Bitcoin seemed to capture the imagination of quite a few. And for good reason.

The last property is the coin distribution. The supply should be capped. Inflation should be handled by the divisibility of the coins. A bitcoin is a hundred million units.

So, before we decide to buy it, we need to understand that bitcoin is a data transfer protocol before it is money. Its software is constantly improving.

When our first internet was created, it started out as ethernet. Ethernet is a broadcast network, it doesn’t scale, and every node on the network communicates with every other node when a request is made. So, our early internet had scaling issues much like Bitcoin does with its seven transactions per second capacity.

To get around the ethernets scalability issues, TCP/IP was made as a routing layer which underpins our modern internet today. Bitcoin's scalability is being addressed in the same fashion. The lightning network
is a routing protocol for Bitcoin. It enables near-free, instant transactions, with approximately 3.2 million tps (NOTE: WHAT DOES TPS MEAN? EXPLAIN TO LAYPERSON (ME)).

Current Lightning Stats.

A problem with assessing Bitcoin’s value is that it’s commonly perceived as a currency or a commodity. These are abstractions of utility. 

##Explain what a currency is. (I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THIS BETTER THAN ME. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE A STAB BEFORE I EDIT?)

When we look at Bitcoin as a network, we can start to understand what value and opportunities it brings to humanity. We can now do commerce without a trusted third party. That’s the entire financial sector. Bitcoin will be making short work of our largest most profitable industry that has ever existed and has enabled our way of life through global commerce and trade. If that isn't enough, it’s introduced competition to the nation states with their central banks for monetary policy.

The next thing we should look at is how Bitcoin revolutionizes computing. The lightning network is an internet. Data can be packaged with payments. This allows the disruption of the FANGM. Cloud computing and storage can now be decentralized through protocols like IPFS, and data can remain private—its use bought and sold by the individual through micro
payments. A new market of digital property is enabled. Atomic Swaps roll up the entire forex market which we sre seeing with strike app.

So, when you own Bitcoin, you don't own a speculative currency. You own a piece of the next generation internet.

My other strategy is squeezing over extended Hedge funds on short positions like GameStop. Ha!
