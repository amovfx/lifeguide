# Curiosity and Creativity

Dr E. Paul Torrance described creativity as "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, 
gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, 
making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly 
modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results."

Sternberg has proposed that creativity has five components: expertise, 
imaginative thinking skills; a venturesome personality; intrinsic motivation; 
and a creative environment that sparks, supports, and refines creative ideas.

In the book Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention, 
psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi defines creative people as:
People who seem stimulating, interesting, and have a variety of unusual thoughts.
People who perceive the world with a fresh perspective, have insightful ideas, and make important personal discoveries. 
These individuals make creative discoveries that are generally known only to them.
Inventors and artists such as 
Thomas Edison and Pablo Picasso would fall into this category, they made great creative achievements that become known to the entire world.
Creatives embrace contradictions. They relish the creative thought it takes to ponder conflict in the world. 
They prefer to challenge tradition, traditional thought, and the idea that something must be done a certain way because 
that’s the way it’s always been done. Creative thinkers with a purpose are constantly looking for new, 
innovative ways to solve old problems. They are process improvement seekers and conquerors. 

Creative people allow their work to create the plan, rather than force a plan upon their work. 
The passion that they have for their work drives them to become masters. They usually become almost obsessed with their 
creative experience to the point where they call it a “rage to master.”  
Creatives engage their work with passion.

Creative people embrace contradictions; relish in pondering the  conflicts of our world. 
They challenge traditions. Creative thinkers with a purpose are looking to innovate and invent. 
They are people who seek problems.

Creative people love new experiences. They engage, explore, and learn from the unfamiliar, both physically and mentally. 
This drives neuroplasticity and satisfies their creative nature. By nature, creative people are sensitive and perceptive. 

Can anyone become creative? Most people think that we either are creative or not – we were either born with it or not… but that’s not true.
We recognize that as "fixed-mindset" thinking. We now have chosen the "growth oriented mindset" so we can start practicing creativity today.

How can we become more creative? 

Remember the kid in class who got caught daydreaming while the teacher was lecturing? 
Whether we did that or not, we were on to something good! 
Daydreaming is an excellent way to get our creative juices flowing. But for many of us, we're taught that daydreaming 
is a bad thing. So, let's permit ourselves to daydream. Think positive about it, and about ourselves engaging in it.

Have you ever had a difficult problem to solve, but came up with the solution while on break? That’s the power of 
daydreaming and intuitive thinking. Daydreaming and intuitive thinking help creative people connect with their inner selves. 
When the conscious mind isn’t working on solving a problem, intuition is free to operate. 

So, take a walk in the park and let your mind wander. Also, meditate and let your thoughts flow but don’t hold on to them. 
Furthermore, embrace solitude to rest your focus.

Take this into your daily life, believe you can do anything – but start with whatever task is at hand right now. 
Do not fear failure. Embrace failure because it’s part of the process of creation. Use misfortune and failure as 
opportunities for growth.

Quantity leads to quality when it comes to generating great ideas. Let the ideas flow,
write them down, and then choose the good ones to polish up. 

Another important topic relative to creativity is procrastination. 
It is often labeled as a negative attribute. Procrastination can be a tool in your problem-solving strategies.
Leaving things to the last minute makes us more creative because it forces us to improvise. When you improvise, 
you engage your lateral thinking skills. This helps you see solutions in new places. There are times when it is 
never a good idea to procrastinate – we must be the one to decide when it is and when it isn’t.

At times, Creative people can be precieved as radical and eccentric. But we must drop that bias and embrace the idea 
of being creative yourself. Make our own radical ideas familiar by getting them out there into the world more often.

New experiences result in inspiration. Learn, explore and engage with the unfamiliar is a key indicator of creative success. 
Exploring the unknown both mentally and physically drives psychological plasticity and gives dopamine. You will love it.

Remove “yes people” who agree with us on everything. The best collaborators are the ones that push back on our ideas. 
This helps us grow.
Develop our ideas and share our best ones with others and surround ourselves with disruptive thinkers. 
Build a psychologicaly safe environment where collaboration can foster and others feel comfortable about sharing ideas and opinions.


Misfortune and problems are now our opportunities.
