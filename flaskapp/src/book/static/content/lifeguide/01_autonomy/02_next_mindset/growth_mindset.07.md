#Mindset

Now that we have learned how to label our emotions and behaviour, this first step of the journey is believing that we can change.
This is the most important,simplest yet difficult step in the journey to success and fulfillment. 

A fixed mindset believes that abilities are set at birth. This is the furthest thing possible from the truth.
Today, we leave that behind and choose a "growth oriented mindset". But where did the fixed mindset it come from?

The education system reinforces a fixed mindset. The grading system encourages us to seek approval over growth. 
We recieve grades regardless of understanding.
The education system also doesn't understand the "natural talent barrier". Natural talent can only take you so far before you hit a ceiling. 
Some people hit this celing earlier than others. To get to the next level, requires focus and diligent practice. So why do people of the same
ages move up at the same rate, in the same subjects?

A growth-oriented mindset believes that with perseverance, we can learn anything. 
The discovery of neuroplasticity proves this. Neuroplasticity shows us that we can shape ourselves into whom we want to be and what we want to do. 
It starts with believing that we can change for the better. With this simple decision you are ready to leave your ill-imposed false limits behind you.

The attributes of a fixed mindset are:

 * Avoiding difficulties.
 * Telling ourselves we are good at something's but not others.
 * View failure as a disaster.
 * Seeking approval over development.

Now that we can recognize fixed-mindset attributes, we can replace them with the following:

 * Seek out difficulties.
 * We achieve what we focus on.
 * Failure is a discovery of a knowledge boundary and should be celebrated.
 * Seek learning and development over approval.

Anyone can adopt a growth mindset. Anyone that told us otherwise lied to us. What we achieve and who we become is our choice.

Want to speed up this change? When meeting someone new, if the opportunity arises, state that we have always had a growth oriented mindset. 
The lie helps the brain rewire to fit the expectation. Over a short period of time, you will start believing it.

The next step is developing our vision, grit, curiosity, humility and patience.
