# Patience

Patience is the ability to control our emotional state. Impatient people are more depressed and have more stress. 
This is an immense skill for waiting for your desired outcome. Some of us have a shorter fuse than others, but anyone 
can develop more patience if they feel that they need it. 
According to research psychologist Sarah Schnitker, patience comes in three main varieties: 

 * Daily hassles patience
 * Life hardship patience
 * Interpersonal patience

A daily hassle event would be something like getting stuck in morning traffic.
A life hardship event would be something like losing our jobs or a cancer diagnoisis. These are more challenging 
because they linger in the background. 
A parent teaching their son or daughter how to drive is an interpersonal event.
All these types of events take patience. 

How can we be more patient? 
When we feel impatient and we feel like lashing out, stop and acknowledge it. We now can label it different. Instead of 
labeling the event as frustrating, label it as opportunity. We are at a knowledge boundary. It is time to practice patience. 
If we are at your limit, remove yourself from the conversation or situation. Make it clear that we will address the situation
when we are calm.  This will be far more effective.

Additionally, there are exercises for patience like meditation and yoga.

Being patient with others doesnâ€™t mean that we should be passive and never stand up for ourselves. 
There are times when it is appropriate to speak up and show your displeasure. 
Get yourself into as calm of a place as you can when you do speak up.  

A lot of people struggle giving up what they want right now, for what they want the most. It's our choice of whom we want to be.
