# Grit

Now that we have decided to improve our lives, the key to achieving it is grit. Grit is about having perseverance and tenacity. 
It is keeping our word to ourselves and others. It helps us stick to our values under pressure and follow through with our goals. 

Grit is essential for creating a satisfying, fulfilled life. We can learn anything but that doesn't mean that it is easy. 
Learning is about discovering our knowledge boundary. When we hit it, grit helps us push through that boundary. That is the key to mastery.

When you decide to do something, commit to it through thick and thin. Do not give up. When we are learning and frustrated, 
that is good. We are at your knowledge boundary. We must seek out challenges above our skill level to improve our grit. 
When we set ourselves a task, we need to define its length and deadline. Then, plan what we must do to stay on track. We repeat this so it becomes a 
habit and a cornerstone of our identity. 

We should do something that we love, but we will always hit rough patches. Hard work can lead to procrastination and doubt but thatâ€™s where grit comes in.
