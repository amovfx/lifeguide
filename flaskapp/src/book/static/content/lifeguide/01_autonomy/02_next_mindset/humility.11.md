# Humility

Humility  comes from understanding our place in the larger order of things. 
It entails not taking our desires, successes, or failings too seriously,
raising our readiness to engage in prosocial behavior. 

The humble person has a more accurate self-perception. They have other-oriented relational stances such as a willingness
to see themselves truthfully. Humble people also can acknowledge their mistakes and limitations. 
These attributes make for excellent cooperators and leaders.

Humility makes us more open to appreciate life, self-aware and adaptable to change. 
It helps our empathy, being aware of our environment and others’ problems, feelings, and emotions.

Everyone gets along better with humble people, and cooperation leads to success. 
For example, if you admit your weakness during a sales pitch, you will help reduce your customers risk. 
They know what they are getting. People trust others more who can look at themselves objectively. 

Humility is essential for growth. It will allow us to recognize people that are better than us. Once you 
identify these people, reach out and ask for help. More often than not, they will help us, people love talking 
about what they are good at.

Those who are not humble should be, and those who are humble have an advantage when it comes to building teams. 
To be humble, is to be honest with one self.

#Compound Advantage

Humility helps us recognize our advantages. How we were raised has a radical impact how successful we become. 
One of the most important factors determining success is when we are born. The next is where we are born, then to whom we are born. Obviously,
if we come of age during a computing revolution, at the center of it, our chances of success rise dramatically.
Practical intelligence is procedural knowledge. Knowing how to interpret and work social situations to get what we want. 
This knowledge is not innate and is taught by our parents and gaurdians.

Where we come from geographically and culturally can have a particularly large effect on what we achieve. Cultural legacy provides a large influence in this.
If we can recognize the uneven playing field, we can start to level it.

Extraordinary success is often the result of an un-likey series of opportunities. Lucky breaks and occurrences combine 
to create conditions that allow for great achievement. I mis-spelled a search on Reddit and was 
introduced to bitcoin by the error's recommendation in 2011.

Many successful people claim to be “self-made.” But that is a myth. No one becomes successful without help 
along the way. We built our society together.  Despite our combined efforts throughout time, the “self-made” myth still persists.
