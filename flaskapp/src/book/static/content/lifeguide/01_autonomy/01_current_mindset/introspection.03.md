# Introspection

To begin this journey, we must be able to acknowledge our shortcomings.

Psychometrics are a great way to start to 
 provide some quick insight into ourselves, but beware,
 pyschometric testing is the astrology of psychology. 
 It is pseudo-science rooted in a for-profit motive. 
 However, they do provide insight into labeling our behaviour.
 
Motivations are important to understand. 
What really motivates us? If we don't understand this, 
others can use this against us to gain leverage in negotiations.
You must have control of your emotions and be able to recognize when someone is appealing to your rational or irrational desires. 

Cognitive biases teach us that more often than not, we are unfortunately our own worst enemy. 
We need to understand our weaknesses, if not we will be forever bound by them.

Once we recognize these pitfalls, we have the tools to effectively manage ourselves and make decisions based on logic and reason.
None of the aforementioned which we observe in ourselves are locked in stone.
**Our individual personalities are fluid and changes with time.** This guide is meant to give
 the power to shape our own story and enable us to be who we want to be.
