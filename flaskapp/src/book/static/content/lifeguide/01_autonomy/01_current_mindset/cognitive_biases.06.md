# Cognitive Biases

We must understand cognitive biases. First we must learn what they are, then attribute our behavior to them.
Next, we need identify external sources that aim to exploit our biases to gain undue influence. 
This is the most important step in taking your life under your control.

Cognitive biases lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgement, illogical interpretation. 
They enable us to construct a subjective reality and not an objective one. These evolved to kept us alive and thriving in the 
paleolithic era, but we advanced rapidly and changed our environment from which they were born.

Understand these and free yourself from them. There are a lot. Wikipedia is an excellent resource for learning about them.

The anti-vaxxers during COVID-19 are a prime example of a group of people led astray by social media exploiting 
cognitive biases.

They ignore an obviously negative situation( Ostritch effect). They refuse to plan for or react to a disaster that has never happened
before(Normalcy bias). They ignore the fact hospitals are full (base rate neglect). They feed of each other's social media creating an availability cascade. 
(Confimation bias, conformity bias).
They are unskilled individuals overestimating their ability to filter information.( The "do your own research crowd" is the Dunning-Kruger effect in full swing).
When some catch COVID-10 and are intubated, they still deny COVID exists (Conservatism bias). Anti-vaxxers believe ivermectin will save them (Optimism bias).
If they are confronted with this, they double down in there position. (Backfire-effect)

What can be said about climate change deniers?

In and many places in the world, the anti-vaxxers have filled up the hospitals. Their cognitive biases are literally killing them.

If we do not understand cognitive biases, the ones that do control ous and the social media algorithms absolutely understand
cognitive biases. Social media algorithms exploit cognitive biases and train viewing habits to maximize profit.

Once we get a good grip on these, we can start building up new habits in ourselves to build the best possible life we can.
