# Autonomy

Autonomy is about having the ability to make your own decisions. It is to define your life as a result of your actions, 
values, feelings and desires. 
It is to self-determine.

Being objective about oneself is an important characteristic of the autonomous person. 
Getting autonomy is much more of an inside job that and outside one.

To first achieve autonomy, we must free ourselves from the lies we tell ourselves. 
Autonomy is about being responsible. Leave blame behind. Next, reflect upon your strengths and weaknesses. 
From this, you will identify your motivations, cognitive biases and bad habits. 
This will prevent external sources from manipulating you. As you can plainly see, if you take the lot of humanity's 
problems such as climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, dying monetary systems, they really boil down to
a small group of people psychologically manipulating the majority.

The first step is understanding the difference between fixed and growth oriented mindsets. 
We must master ourselves before we begin to master our environment.
