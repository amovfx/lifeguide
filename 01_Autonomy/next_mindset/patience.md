# Patience

With this development, one must be patient. Progress isn't a straight line, it falters on it's way to it's destination

As you mastery your journey, you must put in 10 000 of focused hours to reach a world class level. That is about 8-10 years.

To help with this, we can reach to the teachings of Zen.

Trust in the natural abilities of your mind, you can't force your nose to smell better or your tounge to taste better, you cant force yoru mind to be osmething that it is not.

know what you aren't instead of are. Disentangle yourself from abstract identification. You just are.

Attepmting to grasp your reality is impossible.

Free your self from motivation, motivation is just what you are. DO not seek to be more motivated.

The only moment that exists is the preset. There is not past, there is no future.

Watch out for the dangers of abstractions, dismantle the illusions your mind has created. This goes back to freeing yourself 
from the base extrinsic motivators.

You and your circumstances are inseperable. No excuses. People love excuses. THis will help you be resonsible 
for yourself. Your circumstances exists because you have a mind and body to precieve them.

The idea of self or our abstracted identity doesn't even exist, it isn't connected to anything in the real world.

In Zen, you are simply the things you are aware of this moment.

TIp to help this along with other things: Meditate!

Stoicism:

The reward of the task is the task it's self. Excellence in all things is it's own reward.

In order to speed up, we must slow down.
