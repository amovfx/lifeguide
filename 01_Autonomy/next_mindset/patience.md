# Patience

“The key to everything is patience. You get the chicken by hatching the egg, not by smashing it open.” – Arnold Glasow, American humorist.

Patience is the ability to wait for the desired outcome. Some of us have a shorter fuse than others, but anyone can develop more patience if they feel that they need it. 

But why does it even matter? 
A better question is, do you like to be around an impatient person, or a patient one? It doesn’t take rocket science to figure out that everyone prefers to be around a patient person. Impatient people suffer in all aspects of life: their personal lives, their work-life, and their health too. Impatient people are known to be more depressed than others and to have more stress which leads to physical ailments and disease. 
According to research psychologist Sarah Schnitker, patience comes in three main varieties: 
Daily hassles patience
Life hardship patience
Interpersonal patience
A daily hassle event would be something like getting stuck in morning traffic. If you let the frustration get to you, your cortisol levels will rise. Cortisol is a stress hormone that can wreak havoc on your immune system. 
A life hardship event would be something like losing your job or being diagnosed with a medical ailment. This is more challenging because it is something that is constantly lingering in the background. 
An interpersonal event would be something like a parent teaching their son or daughter how to drive. 
All these types of events take patience. 

How can you be more patient? 
If you get yourself into a situation where you feel impatient and you feel like lashing out or saying something harsh to a co-worker, a friend, or a loved one, just don’t do it. Silence is the best answer. If you can, remove yourself from the conversation or the situation and address it later when you can discuss things more calmly. 
To become a more patient person, practice meditation, yoga, or anything that helps you feel calmer. You know what is best for you. 

When you are a more patient person, you will be happier, more flexible with others, and feel more alive. 
You may worry that you may become a push-over if you’re more patient. And it’s true – that is a valid concern. Everything must be done with balance in mind. Being patient with others doesn’t mean that you should be passive and never stand up for yourself. There are times when it is appropriate to speak up and show your displeasure. Just be sure to get yourself into as calm of a place as you can when you do speak up.
