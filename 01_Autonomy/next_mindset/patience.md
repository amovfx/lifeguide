# Patience

“The key to everything is patience. You get the chicken by hatching the egg, not by smashing it open.” – Arnold Glasow, American humorist.

Patience is the ability to control your emotional state. This is an immense skill for waiting for your desired outcome. Some of us have a shorter fuse than others, but anyone can develop more patience if they feel that they need it. 

But why does it even matter? 
A better question is, do you like to be around an impatient person, or a patient one? Impatient people suffer in their personal lives, their work-life, and their health too. They are more depressed and have more stress. When your stressed, leads to physical ailments and disease. 
According to research psychologist Sarah Schnitker, patience comes in three main varieties: 
Daily hassles patience
Life hardship patience
Interpersonal patience

A daily hassle event would be something like getting stuck in morning traffic. If you let the frustration get to you, your cortisol levels will rise. Cortisol is a stress hormone that can wreak havoc on your immune system. 
A life hardship event would be something like losing your job or a cancer diagnoisis. These are more challenging because they linger in the background. 
A parent teaching their son or daughter how to drive is an interpersonal event.
All these types of events take patience. 

How can you be more patient? 
When you feel impatient and you feel like lashing out, stop and acknowledge it. You now can label it different. Instead of labeling the event as frustrating, label it as opportunity. You are at a knowledge boundary. It is time to practice patience. If you are at your limit, remove yourself from the conversation or situation.  Addressing it later when you are calm will be far more effective.
There are exercises for patience like meditation and yoga.

When you are a more patient person, you will be happier, more flexible with others, and feel more alive. 
You may worry that you may become a push-over if you’re more patient. And it’s true – that is a valid concern. Do everything with balance in mind. Being patient with others doesn’t mean that you should be passive and never stand up for yourself. There are times when it is appropriate to speak up and show your displeasure. Get yourself into as calm of a place as you can when you do speak up.  

A lot of people struggle giving up what they want right now, for what they want the most. It's your choice of who you want to be.
