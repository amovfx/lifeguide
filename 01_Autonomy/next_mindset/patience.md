# Patience

Patience is the ability to control your emotional state. Impatient people are more depressed and have more stress. This is an immense skill for waiting for your desired outcome. Some of us have a shorter fuse than others, but anyone can develop more patience if they feel that they need it. 
According to research psychologist Sarah Schnitker, patience comes in three main varieties: 
Daily hassles patience
Life hardship patience
Interpersonal patience

A daily hassle event would be something like getting stuck in morning traffic.
A life hardship event would be something like losing your job or a cancer diagnoisis. These are more challenging because they linger in the background. 
A parent teaching their son or daughter how to drive is an interpersonal event.
All these types of events take patience. 

How can you be more patient? 
When you feel impatient and you feel like lashing out, stop and acknowledge it. You now can label it different. Instead of labeling the event as frustrating, label it as opportunity. You are at a knowledge boundary. It is time to practice patience. If you are at your limit, remove yourself from the conversation or situation.  Addressing it later when you are calm will be far more effective.
There are exercises for patience like meditation and yoga.

Being patient with others doesnâ€™t mean that you should be passive and never stand up for yourself. There are times when it is appropriate to speak up and show your displeasure. Get yourself into as calm of a place as you can when you do speak up.  

A lot of people struggle giving up what they want right now, for what they want the most. It's your choice of who you want to be.
