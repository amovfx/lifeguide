# Curiosity and Creativity

What is creativity? And can anyone become more creative? 
Some say that it is 1) The ability to “create” new ideas that address a problem that hasn’t been solved before and 2) The solution must work. 

To explain it in more detail, in his book Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi defines creative people as:
People who seem stimulating, interesting, and have a variety of unusual thoughts.
People who perceive the world with a fresh perspective, have insightful ideas, and make important personal discoveries. These individuals make creative discoveries that are generally known only to them.
People who make great creative achievements that become known to the entire world. Inventors and artists such as Thomas Edison and Pablo Picasso would fall into this category.
Creative people embrace contradictions. They relish the creative thought it takes to ponder conflict in the world. They prefer to challenge tradition, traditional thought, and the idea that something must be done a certain way because that’s the way it’s always been done. Creative thinkers with a purpose are constantly looking for new, innovative ways to solve old problems. They are process improvement seekers and conquerors. 

Creative people allow their work to create the plan, rather than force a plan upon their work. The passion that they have for their work drives them to become masters. They usually become almost obsessed with their creative experience to the point where they call it a “rage to master.”  They have a need to engage in their work creatively and fully. 

Creative people love new experiences. They engage, explore, and learn from the unfamiliar, both physically and mentally. This drives neuroplasticity and satisfies their creative nature. By nature, creative people are sensitive and perceptive. 
But back to the question…

Can anyone become creative? Most people think that you either are creative or not – you were either born with it or not… but that’s not true.
The answer to the question is yes, anyone can become more creative, but if it doesn’t come naturally to you, you will have to change your mindset and do things a little differently than before. The point is that anyone can increase their creative nature. 

How can you become more creative? 

Remember the kid in class who got caught daydreaming while the teacher was lecturing? Whether that kid was you or not, they were on to something good! Daydreaming is an excellent way to get your creative juices flowing. But for many of us, we have been taught that daydreaming is a bad thing. So, permit yourself to daydream. Think positive about it, and about yourself engaging in it. But also, think positive about yourself. You are probably a lot more creative than you give yourself credit for. You may have labeled yourself as “not creative at all,” and if you do, that belief may be the only thing holding you back. 
Have you ever had a difficult problem to solve, were unable to solve it, finally took a break, only to come up with the perfect solution while you weren’t even thinking? That’s the power of daydreaming and intuitive thinking. Daydreaming and intuitive thinking help creative people connect with their inner selves. When the conscious mind isn’t working on solving a problem, intuition is free to operate. 

So, take a walk in the park and let your mind wander. Also, meditate and let your thoughts flow but don’t hold on to them. Furthermore, embrace solitude which will give you space to focus and concentrate on your passion.

To take this a step further into your daily life, believe you can accomplish anything – but start with whatever task is at hand right now. Do not fear failure. Most creative types learn to embrace failure because they understand that it’s part of the process of creation. Use misfortune and failure as opportunities for growth.
Originality is your key to a fulfilling career, but it takes creativity to be original. This is why creativity is so important. Also, quantity leads to quality when it comes to generating great ideas. Let the ideas flow out of you, write them down, and then choose the good ones. 

There is another important topic relative to creativity and that is the topic of procrastination. 
Procrastination has a bad connotation to it because it is almost always viewed as a negative thing. But procrastination can work creative wonders when you use it strategically. Leaving things to the last minute makes us more creative because it forces us to improvise. And when you improvise, you usually must engage your subconscious mind in a creative way which then helps you to come up with new ideas and solutions to problems. Of course, there are times when it is never a good idea to procrastinate – you must be the one to decide when it is and when it isn’t.

Creative people can be seen as being radical and eccentric. But you must drop that bias and embrace the idea of being creative yourself. Make your own radical ideas familiar by getting them out there into the world often and find common points of reference. That is how to embrace your creative side. 

Creative people are predisposed to welcoming new experiences which result in inspiration. A drive to learn, explore and engage with the unfamiliar is a key indicator of creative success. The desire to explore the new and unknown both mentally and physically is called psychological plasticity and is driven by dopamine.
Also, don’t surround yourself with “yes men” (or women) meaning people who agree with you on everything. The best collaborators are the ones that love to prove you wrong. A bit of critique helps you grow. 
Unleash your creative potential by developing lots of ideas and share your best ones with others. To further boost your creativity, surround yourself with disruptive thinkers and make them feel comfortable about sharing their opinions. Learn to make your original idea seem familiar, accessible, and appealing to get the support you need and you’ll be ready to turn your unique plans into real-world solutions.

Creative people make use of misfortune, turning tough experiences into opportunities for growth.

Sternberg has proposed that creativity has five components: expertise, 
imaginative thinking skills; a venturesome personality; intrinsic motivation; 
and a creative environment that sparks, supports, and refines creative ideas.
