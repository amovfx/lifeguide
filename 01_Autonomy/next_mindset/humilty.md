#Compound Advantage

The self made man is a myth. Their is a talent bias. But it remains a very popular myth.
Once you reach a certain threshold, increased abilities no longer help you succeed.
Innate abilities only take you so far. Past that you have to dig in and work.
World class mastery of anything demands around 10000 hours of practice. Of diligent focused practise. Practise is what makes you good.
How you are raised has a radical impact how successful you become. Practical intelligence is procedural knowledge. Knowing how to interpret and work social situations to get what you want. This knowledge is not innate and is taught by parents.
Where you come from geographically and culturally can have a particularly large effect on what you achieve.
Cultural legacy provides a large influence in this.
If we recognize the reasons behind an uneven playing field we can create opportunities for people to succeed.
Extraordinary sucess is the result of an often-unlikey series of opportunities, lucky breaks and occurrences that combine to create the precise conditions that allow such achievement.
