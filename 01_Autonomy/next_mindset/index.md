This is the most important and easiest step in the journey to success and fulfillment. The first step you need to take is to reorient your mindset from a fixed mindset to a growth-oriented mindset.

A fixed mindset believes that abilities are locked in stone and predetermined at birth, but this is the furthest thing possible from the truth.

A growth-oriented mindset believes that with perseverance, you can learn anything. This is physiologically true through a process called neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity shows us that we can take control and overcome our thought patterns which normally hold us back. The most important thing to do is simply believe that you can change for the better.

With this simple yet important decision to change from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset, you are ready to leave your false limits behind you and begin the journey of developing the character attributes needed.
Our mindset shapes whether we believe we can learn and change and grow, or not. In a traditional fixed mindset, an individual's abilities are set in stone. In a growth mindset, growth and development are possible in all areas. 

This is the key to watch out for; if you tell yourself you can do anything except one thing, you have a fixed mindset. If you recognize that you are seeking approval over development, you have a fixed mindset.
The key is to focus on improvement. How do you react to failure? Is it a disaster or is it an opportunity? Which mindset would label failure as an opportunity to learn? A fixed one or a growth-oriented one? A growth-oriented one of course. 

Something to watch out for is if you are avoiding difficulties. That is a sign of a fixed mindset. When you come to something difficult, it needs to be celebrated because you have discovered your knowledge boundary. See it as an opportunity to celebrate because now you get to practice neuroplasticity and build your grit, focus, determination, and character.

Your mindset often comes from your role models from when you were younger, and from schools telling you that you’re bad at something and good at another. But that doesn't matter anymore. You are now self-aware and are taking your fate into your own hands.
Anyone can adopt a growth mindset and make the impossible possible. Anyone that told you otherwise lied to you.

After deciding to go from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset, we want to develop our character to visualize, our lateral thinking through curiosity to drive creativity, our grit to learn about our world, and the patience and humility to keep us grounded.

Culturally, the fixed mindset is pushed through our schools and our media. What they push is that some are born superior to others, that being a straight-A student is the only indicator that you’re going to be successful and that unless you memorize everything in school that they want you to memorize, you’re going to be a failure. 

The public educational system in most countries is designed to make you believe that your only hope in life is to work for a good company your whole life, save a little for retirement, and then die. It’s designed to create workers – not entrepreneurs. It’s designed to keep you in the dark about fairly important things such as how to balance a checkbook and the dangers of using credit cards. They want you to be happy living a mediocre life!

They purposely do this to take away your hope. Even Henry Ford knew this. He asked if his workers understood the power that they have to create a better life, who would work in his factories? 
They want you to believe that you can't do anything to change your circumstances. One group is born at a disadvantage and taught that there is nothing they can do about it, the other group is born with every advantage and taught that they can do anything. But the truth is, either group can do anything... 
So, from now on, this is your new tactic! Seek out challenges and relish in them! When you are frustrated and just not getting it, you are doing it right. That’s how you learn – that’s how you learn the most and the fastest. Now, you can practice your grit and you can shed the false shackles that bound you before.

How do you develop an autonomous mindset? 
Rewrite your past and talk more about where you are going rather than where you have been. Get determined. Decide now that you are going to go from a fixed mindset to a growth-inspired one. 
Develop a love for learning like never before. Don’t let past experiences and past teachers tell you what you can and cannot do. See yourself as limitless because you are. 
Recognize that most of us lie to ourselves and we lie to each other about who we really are. 
Create a vision. Create new goals that stretch you. Develop willpower. Be humble, be curious, be creative, and be patient. 
We will cover all of that in this chapter. 
Now, let’s put all of this information to good use!
