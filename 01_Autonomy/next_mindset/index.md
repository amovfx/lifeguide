#Mindset

This is the most important and easiest step in the journey to success and fulfillment. The first step is changing your mindset from a "fixed mindset" to a "growth-oriented mindset".A fixed mindset believes that abilities are set at birth. This is the furthest thing possible from the truth.

The education system reinforces a fixed mindset. The grading system encourages us to seek approval over growth. Not understanding the "natural talent barrier". Natural talent can only take you so far before you hit a ceiling. People hit this celing earlier than others. The next level requires focused, diligent practice.

A growth-oriented mindset believes that with perseverance, you can learn anything. The discovery of neuroplasticity proves this. Neuroplasticity shows us that we can shape ourselves into who we want to be and what we want to do. It starts with believing  that you can change for the better. With this simple decision you are ready to leave your false limits behind you.

The attributes of a fixed mindset are:
 * Avoiding difficulties.
 * Telling yourself you are good at somethings but not others.
 * View failure as a disaster.
 * Seeking approval over development.

Now that we can identify and label behavior and it's root causes we can switch our mindset. You now:

 * Seek out difficulties.
 * You can achieve what you focus on.
 * Failure is a discovery of a knowledge boundary.
 * Seek development over approval.

Anyone can adopt a growth mindset and make the impossible possible. Anyone that told you otherwise lied to you. It is a your choice to make.

Want to speed up this change? When meeting someone new, if the opportunity arises, tell them you have always had a growth oriented mindset. The lie helps the brain rewire to fit the expectation. Over a short period of time, you will start believing it.

The next step is developing your vision, grit, curiosity, humility and patience.
