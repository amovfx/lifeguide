This is the most important and easiest step in the journey. The first step you need to take is to reorient
your mindset from a fixed-mindset to a growth oriented mindset.

A fixed mindset believes that abilites are locked in stone and predetermined at birth this is the furthest thing possible from the truth.

A growth oriented mindset believes that with perserverence you can learn anything. This is phsyiologically true through a process called neuro plasticity.
The most important thing to do is simply believe that you can change.

With this simple yet difficult decision you are ready to leave your false limits behind you and begin the journey of devloping the character attributes needed.

Our mindset shapes whether we believe we can learn and change and grow - or not. In 
a traditional fixed mindset, an individual's abilities are set in stone. In a growth mindset,
growth and development are possible in all areas. This is the key to watch out for,
if you are telling yourself you can do anything, but except one thing. You have a fixed mindset.
If you recognize that you are seeking approval over development, your mindset is fixed. Focus 
on improvement. How do you react to failure, is it a disaster or is it an opportunity? Which 
mindset would label failure as an opportunity to learn?

Something to watch out for is if you are avoiding difficulties. That is a sign of a fixed mindset.
When you come to something difficult it needs to be celebrated because you have discovered
your knowledge boundary. That is an opportunity to celebrate because now you get to practice 
and build your grit.

Your mindset often comes from your role models from when you are younger, and from schools telling your
bad at something and good at another, but that doesn't matter anymore. You are now self aware and 
are now taking your fate in your own hands. 


Anyone can adopt a growth mindset and make the impossible possible. ANyone that told you that you couldn't lied to you.

From here we want to develop our character to visualize, our lateral thinking through curiousity to drive creativity, 
our grit to learn about our world and the patience and humility to keep us grounded.



Culturally, the fixed mindset is pushed through our schools and our media. That some are born superior than others, this is by design,
it is this way and has been this way to take away your hope. That you can't do anything to change your
circumstance. One group is born at a disadvantage and taught that there is nothing they can do about it,
the other group is born with every advantage and taught that they can do anything.

So this is the tactic, seek out challenges and relish in them. When you are frustrated and just not getting it,
you are doing it right. You can no practice your grit and you can now shed the false shackles that bound you.

Here is a trick. Rewrite your past, I've always been gritty. I've always loved to learn. We lie to eachother, and we lie to ourselves.
Let's put that to some good use.

# Feeling good is an advantage

Traditional psychology focuses on the negatives without seeing the positives.
Success revolves around happines, not the otherway around. 
When we feel good, we are smarter, fell more motivated and enjoy more success. 
Positive emotions flood our brain with dopamine and serotonin - chemiclas that both make us feel good and boost parts of the brain that are responsible for learning and organizing new information. Happiness improves all parts of our lives.

This gives a performance edge. Adjust your mindset to a positive one. Focus on the positive and not the negative things. Your focus is limited.

Fall up by turning negative momentum into positive momentum. In crisis or adversity makes our mind follow one of three paths. No change, you ended where you started. Further negative consequences, you are worse off and we are afraid of this path. THe third path is we learn from it to become stronger and more capable than before.

Gaining control and focusing on little changes is how you can make the greatest improvements. Write your negative feelings into words diminishes the power of the emotion. Concentrate on small goals. As you accumulate resources, knowledge and confidence you will be able to accomplish greater goals.
