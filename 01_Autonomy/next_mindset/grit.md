# Grit

We have now defined a vision to where we want to go. THe key to achieveing it is grit.

This is a journey of learning, and you have already decided you can learn anything but that doesn't mean that it is easy.

It is one single step, when you come to learning something difficult, you stop and hit your 
head against the problem until you understand what you are learning. This is key to mastery.

When you decide to do something. Commit to it through thick and thin. Do not give up.
Seek out challenges above your skill level to improve your grit.
Set yourself a task, define it’s length and deadline. Plan what you have do do to stay on track.
Repeat and build it into a habit as a cornerstone of your identity.

It is true that you should do something that you love, but you will always hit rough patches. Hardwork can lead to procrastianation and doubt and thats where grit comes in. With determination and resolve, you can motivate yourself to keep working toward your goals and persevere thorugh the toughest of times.

It can be built, it is like a muscle. Take on a challenge to practice it.
Take an achievable task, define it’s length and deadline. Plan what you need to do each day in order to stay on track. Rinse and repeat until you get awesome at this.



### Willpower

Grit is closely tied to willpower. It is a limited resource that closely
associated with bloodsugar, sleep and is a limited resource.

“I won’t” - Which habit is interfering with long terms goals such as health and happiness.
“I will” - The ability to do what you dislike in the present for long term gain.
“I want” - visualizing the future you want.


Exercising I will and I wont drain the same resource.

What we will learn in future chapters is how to build a lifestyle around healthy habits 
that maximize our willpower so we can use that limited resource to moving
towards our vision.

It has a limited reserve. Doing things you don’t like and not doing things you do like takes energy from the same source.
It is a biological instinct that protects us from harm in the long run. 
It’s a response similar to “fight or flight”. It is “pause and plan”.

Mindful meditation increases awareness and helps avoid distractions. When you are distracted you are more likely to fall into temptation.
Eat low glycemic foods, such as nuts, cereals, fruits, vegetables and grams,
You can keep a small temptation nearby so you can regularly refuse.it.
Don’t indulge in the present. Thinking that you are virtuous lowers self awareness and then we are less likely to control ourselves.
Manage stress. Stress can trigger downward spirals. Feeling bad can trigger cravings and high expectations.
Imagine your future self looking back on your present self.
Visible rewards makes us overestimate the benefits of instant gratification and underestimate the value of exerting self-control. Distancing yourself from the temptation makes the temptation weaker.
Pushing aside temptations makes the craving stronger. Use the “I will” component to drown out the “I wont”. Ex. I will eat healthy instead of “I won’t”.
Willpower is contagious. Practicing it socially increases the likelihood of success from 24% to 66%.
