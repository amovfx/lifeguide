# Grit

We have now defined a vision of where we want to go. The key to achieving it is grit. Grit is having the perseverance, passion, and determination to keep your word to yourself and others, whether that be in sticking to your values under pressure or setting and following through with your goals. 

Grit can also be applied to learning. Creating a satisfying, fulfilled life is a journey of learning, and you have already decided you can learn anything but that doesn't mean that it is easy.
Learning is just one single step, but it can be hard if you don’t have grit. If you want to learn anything, many times you must hit your head against the problem until you understand what it is that you are learning. That takes grit. That is the key to mastery.

When you decide to do something, commit to it through thick and thin. Do not give up. Seek out challenges above your skill level to improve your grit. Set yourself a task, define its length and deadline. Plan what you must do to stay on track. Repeat and build it into a habit as a cornerstone of your identity.

You should indeed do something that you love, but you will always hit rough patches. Hard work can lead to procrastination and doubt and that’s where grit comes in. With determination and resolve, you can motivate yourself to keep working toward your goals and persevere through the toughest of times. 

Grit can be built; it is like a muscle. Take on a challenge to practice it. Take an achievable task, define its length and deadline. Plan what you need to do each day to stay on track. Rinse and repeat until you get awesome at this. 


### Willpower

Willpower is the ability to do what you dislike in the present for the long-term benefit and gain. “I will” is a powerful statement, hence the word, “willpower.” “I will” is a statement of strong intention but without grit, it loses strength. 
“I won’t” against bad habits is also a powerful statement of intent such as “I won’t eat that delicious piece of chocolate cake!” 
Interestingly, “I will” and “I won’t” drain the same limited resource. Doing things you don’t like and not doing things you do like takes energy from the same source. It is a biological instinct that protects us from harm in the long run. It’s a response similar to “fight or flight.” It is “pause and plan.”
You can use mindful meditation to increase awareness of yourself, avoid distractions and it helps you to retain your willpower. To keep the reserve of mental determination you need for willpower, another good thing to do is to eat low glycemic foods, such as nuts, cereals, fruits, vegetables, and grains. But another seemingly contradictory thing you can do is to keep a small portion of “bad” foods nearby so you can regularly refuse it – just make sure to not indulge!
To embrace willpower, don’t indulge in the present temptations that surround you. Also, embrace the feeling of humility which we will cover next. Thinking that you are virtuous lowers self-awareness and then you are less likely to control yourself. 
Another thing to keep your willpower tank full is to manage stress. Stress can trigger downward spirals. Feeling bad can trigger cravings and high expectations. 
Distancing yourself from the temptation makes the temptation weaker. Pushing aside temptations makes the craving stronger. It’s better to not have the temptation in the first place. 
In other words, use the “I will” component to drown out the “I won’t.” For example, say “I will eat healthy” instead of “I won’t eat that chocolate cake!” 
Willpower is contagious. Practicing it socially increases the likelihood of success from 24% to 66%. If you can imagine your future self looking back on your present self, it will be easier to exercise willpower.
Something to keep in mind about willpower is that willpower is weak; you will have much more success rearranging your environment.
