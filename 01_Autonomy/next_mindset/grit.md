# Grit

We have now defined a vision to where we want to go. THe key to achieveing it is grit.

This is a journey of learning, and you have already decided you can learn anything but that doesn't mean that it is easy.

It is one single step, when you come to learning something difficult, you stop and hit your 
head against the problem until you understand what you are learning. This is key to mastery.

### Willpower

Grit is closely tied to willpower. It is a limited resource that closely
associated with bloodsugar, sleep and is a limited resource.

Exercising I will and I wont drain the same resource.

What we will learn in future chapters is how to build a lifestyle around healthy habits 
that maximize our willpower so we can use that limited resource to moving
towards our vision.
