# Grit

Now that you have decided to improve your life, the key to achieving it is grit. Grit is about having perseverance and tenacity. It is keeping your word to yourself and others. It helps you stick to your values under pressure and follow through with your goals. 

Grit is essential for creating a satisfying, fulfilled life.  You can learn anything but that doesn't mean that it is easy. Learning is about discovering your knowledge boundary. When you hit it, grit helps you push through that boundary. That is the key to mastery.

When you decide to do something, commit to it through thick and thin. Do not give up. When your learning and frustrated, that is good. You are at your knowledge boundary. Seek out challenges above your skill level to improve your grit. Set yourself a task, define its length and deadline. Plan what you must do to stay on track. Repeat and build it into a habit as a cornerstone of your identity. 

You should indeed do something that you love, but you will always hit rough patches. Hard work can lead to procrastination and doubt and that’s where grit comes in. 


### Willpower

Willpower is the ability to do what you dislike in the present for the long-term benefit and gain. 
“I will” is a powerful statement, hence the word, “willpower.” “I will” is a statement of strong intention but without grit, it loses strength. 

“I won’t” against bad habits is also a powerful statement of intent.  

“I will” and “I won’t” drain the same limited resource. Doing things you don’t like and not doing things you do like takes energy from the same source. It is a biological instinct that protects us from harm in the long run. It’s a response like “fight or flight.” It is “pause and plan.”

You can use mindful meditation to increase awareness of yourself. It helps avoid distractions and it helps you to keep your willpower. To keep the reserve of mental determination you need for willpower.  Eat low glycemic foods, such as nuts, cereals, fruits, vegetables, and grains. Practice "I won't" by keeping of “bad” foods nearby so you can refuse it – make sure to not indulge!

To embrace willpower, don’t indulge in the present temptations that surround you. Also, embrace the feeling of humility which we will cover next. Thinking that you are virtuous lowers self-awareness which jeopardizes your self-control. 

Another thing to keep your willpower tank full is to manage stress. Stress can trigger downward spirals. Feeling bad can trigger cravings and high expectations. 
Distancing yourself from the temptation makes the temptation weaker. Pushing aside temptations makes the craving stronger. It’s better to not have the temptation in the first place. 
In other words, use the “I will” component to drown out the “I won’t.” For example, say “I will eat healthy” instead of “I won’t eat that chocolate cake!” You will have much more success rearranging your environment. Remove triggers from your life for things you don't want to do.

Willpower is contagious. Practicing it, with others, increases the likelihood of success from 24% to 66%. Surround yourself with people that you want to emulate. Imagine your future self looking back on your present self. It will be easier to exercise willpower.
Remember that willpower is weak and you have limited reserve.
