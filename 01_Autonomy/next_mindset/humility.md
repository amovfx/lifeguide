# Humility

Humility  comes from understanding our place in the larger order of things. 
It entails not taking our desires, successes, or failings too seriously.
There are fascinating links between humility and effective leadership. 
It raises our readiness to engage in prosocial behavior. For example, the humble person has more accurate 
self-perception. They have other-oriented relational stances such as a willingness
to see themselves truthfully. 
They also can acknowledge their mistakes and limitations. 

Humility makes you more open to appreciate life, self-aware and adaptable to change. Then, aware of your environment and others’ problems, feelings, and emotions. Empathy. Many successful people claim to be “self-made.” But that is a myth. No one becomes successful without help  along the way. We built our society together.  Despite our combined efforts throughout time, the “self-made” myth still persists.

Everyone gets along better with humble people, and cooperation leads to success. For example, if you admit your weakness during a sales pitch, you will help reduce your customers risk. They know what they are getting. People trust others more who can look at themselves objectively. Humility is essential for your growth. It will allow your to recognize people that are better than you. Once you identify these people, reach out and ask for help so you can level up faster.

Those who are not humble should be, and those who are humble have an advantage. To be humble, is to be honest with oneself.
