# Humility

Humility is an attitude of spiritual modesty that comes from understanding our place in the larger order of things. 
It entails not taking our desires, successes, or failings too seriously.
There are fascinating links between humility and our ability to learn and be effective leaders, 
and our readiness to engage in prosocial behavior. For example, the humble person has more accurate 
self-perception and self-portrayal. They possess other-oriented relational stances such as a willingness
to see themselves truthfully and an accurate perception of their place in the world. 
They also can acknowledge their mistakes and limitations. 

Additional characteristic benefits of being humble are that the humble person is more open and has an appreciation of the value of all things. They are also more self-aware, adaptable to change, and therefore more aware of their environment and others’ problems, feelings, and emotions.
 Many successful people who are not humble claim to be “self-made.” But that is a myth. No one becomes successful without help and assistance along the way in one way or another. But still, the “self-made” man or woman remains a very popular myth.

Everyone gets along better with humble people, and it can lead to success. For example, if you admit your weakness during a sales pitch, you will garner more support than if you pretend that you have no weakness. People trust others more who can look at themselves objectively and from a place of humility. 
Once you reach a certain threshold, increased abilities no longer help you succeed. Innate abilities only take you so far. Past that, you must dig in and work. World-class mastery of anything requires around 10,000 hours of practice – of diligent focused practice. Practice is what makes you good. 
How you are raised has a radical impact on how successful you become. Practical intelligence is procedural knowledge which is knowing how to interpret and work social situations to get what you want. This knowledge is not innate and is taught by parents. Where you come from geographically and culturally can have a particularly large effect on what you achieve. Cultural legacy provides a large influence in this. But the successful person who is not humble will not recognize their advantages. 
If we recognize the reasons behind an uneven playing field, we can create opportunities for people to succeed. Extraordinary success is the result of an often-unlikely series of opportunities, lucky breaks, and occurrences that combine to create the precise conditions that allow such achievement.
The point is that those who are not humble should be, and those who are humble have an advantage. 
Choose humility and you will go farther than if you don’t…
