# Vision


After you have made the decision that you can do anything, you must start visualizing the life you want to live.

The human brain isn't wired to think past one or two years from the evolution of our development. But like anything, this is something that can learned.

Another good question to ask yourself is, where do you want to be in 15-20 years? Where do you have to be in 10? Where do you have to be in 5? Where do you have to be in 1? Where do you have to be next month? Where do you have to be tomorrow? This vision should be in line with your intrinsic motivators and identity. 

First, we build the long view timeline and start breaking it down into manageable goals. This is also called starting with the end in mind. These don't have to be set in stone, it will change as you grow as a human being.

To start building your vision skills, start small. Every evening, write down what you would like to do the next day. Visualize yourself doing it before you go to sleep. Make sure you do it! This builds self-trust. Start with an easy manageable task, like making your bed first thing. You want to build a good habit, which we talk about the next chapter. As you get better at this, expand upon it. When you start to notice yourself failing, walk some tasks back.
