# Vision


After you have made the decision that you can do anything, you must start visualizing the life you want to live.

The human brain isn't wired to think past one or two years from the evolution of our development. But like anything, this is something that can be practiced and learned.

I highly recommend you choose something that helps people other than yourself. This is the definition of purpose which we will cover in-depth in Part 3: Purpose. It is the final and most important step to achieving a fulfilling life. 

If you only focus on yourself, you will be trapped in the second stage of mastery. No amount of money, social status, or seeming success will give you the fulfillment that you really want. The question to ask yourself is, if you suddenly had unlimited amounts of money, traveled to every place on earth you wanted, bought every gizmo, house, and car of your dreams, what would you do with your life then? 

To create a life of fulfillment, the answer is to give back to others – to help humanity thrive. That is the ultimate gift you can give to others and yourself…

Another good question to ask yourself is, where do you want to be in 15-20 years? Where do you have to be in 10? Where do you have to be in 5? Where do you have to be in 1? Where do you have to be next month? Where do you have to be tomorrow?

First, we build the long view timeline and start breaking it down into manageable goals. This is also called starting with the end in mind. Another good question to ask yourself is, “What do I want to be written on my tombstone?” This will help you identify what you need to start doing today.
This doesn't have to be set in stone, it will change as you grow as a human being.

Every evening, write down what you would like to do the next day and visualize yourself doing it tomorrow beforehand. This way, you program your subconscious mind to start working on creating tomorrow and then tomorrow will go much more smoothly than normal.

Of course, this vision should be in line with your intrinsic motivators and identity. Write down your current projects and tasks to be completed. We will get more into that later.
