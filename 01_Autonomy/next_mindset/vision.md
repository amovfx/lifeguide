# Vision

After you have made the decision that you can do anything, you must start visualizing the life you want to live.

The human brain isn't wired to think past one or two years from evolution of our development.
But like anything, this is something that can be practiced and learned.

I highly recommend you choose something that helps other people that yourself.
THis is the definition of purpose. It is the final and most important step
to achieving a fullfilling life. If you focus on yourself, you will be trapped 
in the second stage of mastery. No amount of money, social status

Where do you want to be in 15-20 years.
Where do you have to be in 10?
Where do you have to be in 5?
Where do you have to be in 1?
Where do yo have to be next month?
Where do you have to be tommorow?

First we build the long view timeline and start breaking it down into manageable goals.
THis will help us identify what we need to start doing today.

This doesn't have to be set in stone, it will change as you grow as a human being.

Every evening, write down what you would like to the next day and visualize your self doing it tommorow.

This vision should be in-line with your intrinsic motivators and identity.

Current tasks to be completed.

Current projects. These generate level one tasks.

Accountabilities. Personal growth. Health. Finances. Socialization. Family. Planning. These generate level 2 tasks.

Yearly goals. Where do you want to be in a year. These generate level 3 tasks.

Long term vision. WHere do you want to be in three to 5 years. Career aspirations. These generate level 4 tasks.

Lifeâ€™s purpose. Why do you exist? These generate level 5 tasks.

### Goal Management

Pick a singular goal well defined goal.

Make a specific decision.

Write it down. If it is large break it down to sub-goals.

Set a realistic due date. Visualize the steps. If it is big, break it down into sub-goals.

List everything you can do to achieve the goal.

Prioritize your list with the most difficult first.

Start immediately.

Do something everyday. At the very least, sit down and look at it. This is the non-zero day concept.

Turn your progress into a habit.
