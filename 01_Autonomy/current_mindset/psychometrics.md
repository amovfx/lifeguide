#Psychometric testing

Psychometric testing is simply a fancy way of saying “personality test.” As stated earlier, 
it’s practically full-blown pseudoscience. However, what they do give insight into is a wide variety of personality 
traits and behaviors which you may discover about yourself. When you do these tests, you will identify some behaviors 
you do, and it will help you label your actions with emotions. It will give insight into who you really are, but take 
all of these tests with a grain of salt. One slightly different answer to the questions can give you dramatically 
different results. Your personality is not fixed at birth, and you can change anything about yourself that you want to.
There are a variety of tests that you can do to learn more about yourself.

These have been developed by psychologists measuring personality attributes. These measurements are used in dating sites 
and corporations use them to drive cooperation and teamwork. Even though they are a bit like reading a horoscope, you 
can use these to gain valuable insight into yourself, focus on your strengths and address your weaknesses. They are
really helpful for identifying and labeling your behaviour.
