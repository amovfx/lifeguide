# Motivations

###Extrinsic motivators
These are quite common, THere are 6 major extrinsic motivators. Money, power, sex, social staus, and knowledge.

These are very strong but not as strong as your intrinsic motivators. 
What helps is to jujitsu these into a certain order. Aquire knowledge for self
mastery, which allows your to understand and master your environment. This will help you
aquire money, which brings social status in a capitalist oriented society, which then comes power and sex.

The idea is to focus your energy on one, and then the rest are just a by product of excellence.
Money seeks out excellence.

THe short term pleasure of achieving luxury goods gives us pleasure, but not
enjoyment which is more difficult to obtain.

Enjoyment involves stretching us past the apparent limitation of our genes and enables
us to gain control over our attention.

###Intrinsic Motivators

What is incredibly important to know is that extrinsic motivators destroy intrinsic motivation.
Example of artists stopping after an hour of being paid.

Not everyone has this, about 85% of people are intrinsically motivated.
You intrinsic motivation is the thing you do
