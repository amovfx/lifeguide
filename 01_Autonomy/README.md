# Autonomy

To first achieve autonomy must free ourselves from ourselves. It begins with introspection 
and identifying our strengths and weaknesses so we can strive for an objective understanding of reality.

We need to identify our bad habits and start replacing them with good ones. 
We must master ourselves before we begin to master aspects of our environment.

Major cognitive biases hold us back, if we don't understand our extrinsic motivations
we become enslaved to them and easily manipulated.

Psychologists have developed some tests that provide insight into your character.

We need to identify the lies we tell ourselves and face the challenges we have been avoiding.
