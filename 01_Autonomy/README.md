# Autonomy

Autonomy is about having the capacity to think independently and to be objective about yourself, others, and reality. 
It’s also about respecting one’s ability to make decisions and judgment calls on their own without 
needing close oversight, and without having to be coerced. For example, an autonomous worker is a worker who does not 
need a boss micro-managing the work. 

Viewing a person as autonomous is also supposed to be how the medical field views 
their patients – as autonomous beings who have the right to make their own healthcare decisions. 
Being objective about oneself is an important characteristic of the autonomous person. An example of this is that of the 
entrepreneur. To be successful, the entrepreneur must have the ability to be objective about their strengths and 
weaknesses to build a business that not only can survive but thrive. The point is that becoming autonomous should be 
one of your first goals, but it’s much more of an inside job than an outside one. In other words, you must develop the 
right mindset to become autonomous. 

To first achieve autonomy, we must free ourselves from ourselves meaning freeing ourselves from the shackles 
of both idealistic thinking and disbelief too. Autonomy is about being balanced – it’s about balancing creativity and 
dreams with reality in a way that leverages the power of oneself and that of others to create the vision. Balance is the 
key, along with having the determination and focus to create the reality that you want. 

It begins with introspection and identifying our strengths and weaknesses so we can strive for an objective 
understanding of reality. We need to identify our bad habits and replace them with good ones. We must master ourselves 
before we begin to master aspects of our environment. This is an important key to success and fulfillment.
But major cognitive biases can hold us back. The objective, autonomous person is mindful that she may have biases, and 
so chooses to listen more and come to instant conclusions less. If we don't understand our extrinsic motivations, we 
become enslaved to them and easily manipulated. 

Psychologists have developed some tests that provide insight into your character. We will cover this in the first chapter. 
The point is that we need to identify the lies we tell ourselves and face the challenges we have been avoiding.

To become an autonomous person, you must develop an inner drive that leads to passion and dedication. That passion and 
dedication lead to a feeling of meaningfulness, happiness, and fulfillment. Self-determination from autonomy promotes 
intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is about lighting a fire within oneself instead of reacting to external 
heat to get you motivated. As one basketball coach said, it is better to light a fire in the heart of a player than to 
light a fire under his feet…

Now we will cover the introspection that you need to be objective about yourself. It’s about examining your current 
mindset, not from a place of judgment and condemnation, but the grounded place of reality. The first step to progress 
in anything is first admitting that there may be a problem…

“Houston, we have a problem!” 

Don’t wait until it’s almost too late. Learn how to develop autonomy by first examining where you are, and then under 
Chapter 2: The Autonomous Mindset, we will get into the best mindset to become autonomous.
